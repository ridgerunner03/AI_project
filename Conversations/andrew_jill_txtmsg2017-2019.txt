Do you know what you like to do in Myrtle Beach tomorrow
	I was going to search for a Groupon
The kids seem interested in family kingdom but I could do anything
	Yeah and it seems like a lot of money to spend over going to six flags next weekend
	Maybe we should just go to James island county Park water park
	Or the beach
	It's up to you...
i was sorta thinking about that
	If you want to do a day trip we could go to Columbia

what would you like for dinner tonight?
	you want me to pick up hibachi 
Nah I have a pork here that needs to be cooked we are good
	ok would you like me to cook it?
	because you see how if you don't let me figure dinner out then no one is taking care of you?
	Ok I lied hibachi sounds great from hibachi hut in Ashley River road chicken bowl
ok

Jude just told me reading has become a lot more fun since he has learned how to do it better
And then my heart exploded
	that's awesome bean
	you should feel proud
I really do

So now PG is saying they are not sure if they need me next week.
Basically being there emergency person means they can treat me like crap
	WHAT?!?!
Yep
	i think i'd push back a little bit and say there is actually a bit of prep that needs to go into this so if you want a good product you need to give me a solid answer
I did they said they can't
This is why I'm like I want to go part-time so I don't have to say yes to these crazy ridiculous thing
	can you say you don't feel comfortable doing something without having prepared and back out
	then you get your week back
I might try that...but I already spent the money on the baptism
	doesn't matter we can figure out the money
	it is more important to me that you go into the school year happy and sane
It will be fine, I think the bigger problem here is how they want to use me and I'm not great at the lack of plan with kids.
	i totally hear that
	fail to plan and you plan to fail and all like that
It's the same problem again and again.. I'm always being put in these awkward positions. It's just not my skill set
	it seems like it is becoming your skill set
But at a great personal tole
	true

Love you
	You, too

So it's official I am leading camp I get $2000, but I'll have to spend at least $300 on supplies
	are you happy or anxious about it working out like that
Both
	that's fair it is a bit of a precarious position for you to be in
What time you coming home tonight?
	why are there plans?
No, I just thought I might go work out
But no big deal I know you have big wigs with you...
	i was thinking between 5:30 and 5:45 but i can get home earlier if that's too late
No we are at sky zone won't be home till 630 anyway
	k, perfect
Today was hard with the Dr appts I just need a sec...
	i didn't know you went to the dr today
The boys orthodontist and chiropractor
	oh yeah i knew about those
	what did they say about Josh at the chiropractor?
He's okay but he did adjust his hips a little.

I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 2.
And I spent 45 minutes today on the phone with dubose about this woman
	did you tell him your concerns
Yes...they have done a ton for this woman its kinda crazy
	do you feel less bad about them asking her to get a psych eval now?
Kinda but then they basically asked me to donate my money from next week to her....
It was sketchy
	hmmmm
i'd feel differently if i thought she was poor or sick but she isn't really either
I guess she is sick...
?
I mean she has/had cancer
	i thought you said she was in remission
She wants money for some experimental treatment
To prevent reoccurrence

They booked me for the wrong type of doctor's appointment and so I still don't have my results back
And I ended up just leaving
	OMG that's so annoying! It's like you just can't catch a break this week
Yeah, I know

You have the boys at 5:30 right
	yes i'm leaving here no later than 4:50
depends on this meeting

You should go out and do something nice for yourself when you're done at the tutoring center since you don't have the boys
I can get them home washed up and fed
	Okay, sounds good

I think I need a new front tire where would you like me to go

thinking about you, hope your morning went ok

Can you stop and pick up some nighttime undies on your way home
	Sure do you remember his size?

I think I have answers
	Okay, thanks

How's it going?
You ok
	Can you call me when you get a sec

i hate to bring this up but would it be a good idea if we got a watch for your mom too?
	Mmmm...
we could put an app on her phone that lets us know where she is as well if you think that would work better
	Yeah maybe

What did you decide I might take boys to see Matilda the musical
	i don't really want to go out with the office
i'm happy to hang out with the boys or chill at home alone
Okay shows sold out. I've been cleaning etc. Why don't we rent guardians one and chill
	k
sounds great

Boys and I just finished lunch and we are going to lay down
	Ok my dad's coming at 2 remember

i should have a bunch of delicious food to bring home
	Why is that
leftovers from the office
i'm not sure what will be left but right now there are shrimp and grits and mac and cheese and greenbeans
	Cool

i love you
	I love you too

I felt so good all day and now...I have the worst headache
	Drink water
I did

Feeling good is good
	Better than I've felt in a long time !!!
That's great

how did the sermon go?
	Good

There was an active shooter near the kids camp today...they are fine but we're on lockdown awhile
	ppl are crazy
Yes yes they are

i think it might rain

I think my job is actually a lot less safe at Porter doubt than I thought
They keep talking about how the Episcopal identity is not a boundary condition and could go away
	i don't think they will move on that until the law suit is figured out

Wow so much good stuff happening at Drayton this year!!
	Did they fire the principal
No...I think maybe he got some fire
	Moved to open court phonics! Yay! And, less homework no stupid spelling lists
	No more color charts!!!

Bryan just said there is an open position on this new project but it is going to be overtime
	Hmmm....
i think it will be good experience
do you not want me to put my name in?
Why not?
yeah that's what i was thinking
i think it will be a good opportunity and between that and my promotion next year (God willing) it my lessen our need for Porter Gaud
Awesome speaking my language
i do hear you saying you don't like it there i just don't have a ton of options right now but i'm trying
I know it's ok
i love you
I love you too
I forgot your cards can you pick them up from me tomorrow or should I go back to school to get then?
yeah could you do it first thing tomorrow?  i could get them after my shot, after i drop off the kids
Yes
did you say you have a expedia account?
No
didn't you tell me you were busy most of tomorrow?
Yes
Can you call me when you get a sec
I'm free now if you are
I thought the boys watches had come but it was your drugs I think
Oh no it's my backpack tags
Josh almost lost his retainer at RR...
Ooops
How's it going?
I miss you guys!
My show got cancelled so I'm making some healthy meals
Miss you guys
Our ETA is 3, when do you need to leave for gymnastics?
415
K
How's it going
i think i'm ready for retirement
any thoughts on how i can make that happen?
I just got kicked out of teaching reading again
Can we move
that is so stupid
didn't julie put you in there?
No Diana was going to split me in but she changed her mind
Which honestly was a good decision for everyone but me.
that sucks
Yeah I'm like irrationally sad about
i don't understand how it would be a good decision for the children to only have whole language teachers
She doesn't want to change anything this year she wants to observe and see what really needs to be changed
so you aren't going to do the testing then?
that seems like something that would be good to do and you don't even have to change anything immediately
Nope
I think that just like everyone else at porter-gaud it's too stressful to try and change anything so it's easier to keep it status quo
And, she's drinking the water that we're not at school for students in need
Which is true. So really it's just not the right place for me which is not news
right and if she was to do the testing she'd have to face the reality that most kids would fail
Right
There is a chaplaincy job open in Columbia and the housing price is much lower there and there's a great school for dyslexic children
no i think when we move we need to get out of the state
Ok
i think you were right we need to find states and counties that have really great public ed and look for placements around there
Ok...I'm just feeling really defeated
i understand that, it sounds like a hard environment
perhaps you can look to get your masters and just hide in your office 
Yeah
that's basically what charles does right?  he just hides in his office and studies
Yes

This is the hibachi hot I love can you pick up dinner tonight
yes
I just got into a car accident. Can you please print out the Geico stuff for me to keep in my car
This women is asking for my insurance info I need to text her
I'm figuring it out
Ok
I think I should still be covered as a driver even if my car isnt
I placed a claim you can give the woman our info
What info she's asking for insurance information I don't have that


I'm gonna get the habachi for you
Wanted to give you a heads up that Geico will be calling you again
Got it
our home is valued at 279k right now

So this happened
Lol
I ordered all the food stuff for baptism today.
I need your phone


It's really crazy ...and I still have to get them dinner and go have my TB results read we won't be home till 8
I'm sorry that it is so crazy right now.  do you want me to pick you up some food or something?
No it's cool
Ummm maybe why?
No reason just thought it would be nice to see some frendly faces... We don't have to if you don't want
Can I tell you tonight? I feel bad that I haven't been with the boys I'd like to ask them
I really messed up this morning can't stop crying
why what happened?
It's just obvious no one wants me here
It kinda sucks
I don't think that is true.  Hudson may not be happy with you but the reality is that he's on his way out.
All the teachers just think I'm wasting time with their students
maybe, it may just be that they are so focused on what they are doing that they just see you as a break.
That would be fine they see me as an Intruder
well they don't know you yet and I'm sure that they have all been there for a thousand years.  You'll win them over.  That's why this football game is important.
I think I have a bit of that stomach thing you were talking about
Do you know our Netflix password
yes
we got 4 paychecks!
st james, black fadora, east cooper, and porter gaud
48UvGW6hY44Z7gzs!
Wow!!! I bet black frdora is even pretty good this month
$135
Oh they must pay every two weeks. I just added a couple of things to our shared calendar. If it's on there that means im hoping youll take the boys. Let me know if you can't
what day?
All my black frdora shows in Sept and Wednesday kids while I have parent night plus my conference in oct
so don't hear this as a criticism but were you able to get the shared calendar on your phone?
i got the dates and I don't think there should be a problem
I don't know why does it help if I have it on my phone
I just got a notification to my phone that you cancelled my event
i didn't cancel anything, you had put the things in your calendar instead of the shared family calendar and I started to switch it and then it occurred to me that you may not have the shared calendar so I just put it back
Oh I guess I did it wrong ok...I'll try again
no I can switch it if you want it switched or you can just leave it
my concern was that if you don't have the shared calendar then you won't be able to see my events
I'm so confused!!! I have the shared calendar I just don't know how to add to it I'm pathetic
no you aren't it is tricky the first time that you have to use it
so just under the blue section it says events and your email, you touch that and you should be able to choose which calendar you want
your self worth isn't determined by google, you are not pathetic
I think I got it you check
that worked
but to be clear the nights that you have gin club but it doesn't say black fedora on the shared calendar you don't need me?
Lol
You're old
I don't know what I'm going to do I can't get home for the bud
Bus
What time does the bus come
Can you stop and get a cheap black eye liner pencil I want to spirit up the boys
Sure did you figure out the bus thing cuz. Can go

I don't know what it did that....
I need to try that route
Awesome thanks
I love you I am so happy that we are married
Me too
What are your thoughts about dinner
And can Molly come to the game
No to Molly but French dip is super good and I saved you the other half of mine
Oh cool thanks
Lol
You're going to feed Molly before you leave right?
Why?
Did you double check your flight time?
I have my ticket in hand nothing changed
I'm trying to download a show from Netflix but the airport WiFi is so sloww
Ok
You ok?
Yeah I'm on the plane now getting ready to take off so I'm better
I'll text when I land
I love you
Ok love you. Lonely without you
We landed
Awesome good night
Goodnight I hope you sleep well
Me too
Good morning

Molly and I waiting for the boys in the rain
I know she's happy to be invited
Finally out of class for the day
We are headed back to the hotel now
Sad news, The Cosi in Alexandria is gone
Super sad
How's it going?
Good morning! I love you. You are amazing and I'm very proud of how well this new job is going!!!
Hope you have a great day!! I can't wait to get back home to y'all
Do you think I can run the PowerPoint while presiding if I have a click er
How many slides?
I did during FFF but I really didn't have very many slides
Ok I think it will be fine
I just had a second gradee tell me he doesn't give a crap about my story
Lol
Im sorry, that's awful
So yeah that happened
Are you ok?
He's just a brat
What you are teaching these kids is invaluable and important unfortunately they don't realize that yet. The relationships and connections you make with kids and teachers will make aneternal difference
In the south we have to fight the culture of Christendom
I've totally hit a wall
No I'm tired and dtressed
What else do you have to do tonight?
I'm taking off now I don't want to wake you so I'll see you when I get home
I love you
Still haven't taken off...
Oh hmm. I have to make lunches and fold laundry still
Why don't you put the laundry off, I can do that tomorrow morning
It's ok at least kids are down now and stuff is ready for chapel
You're gonna be great tomorrow
I'm stressed
I know but you've got this
This is the smallest plane known to man
You're a really good priest and an amazing mom
OMG stop worrying me
Why are you worried?
Small plane late ahhh
I'm too tall to see out the window lol
Ok we are finally going to take off see you at home
Love you
Of course my chapel has a dance class outside while its happening. Why not?
What? That sounds distracting why don't you tell them to move
They have no where to go...it's ok. Dubose is coming he'll probably fix it
Maybe...
Well if you can't beat 'em..
Turns out I have a min. I think I should get my nails done
Totally, you've earned it
How did chapel go? Did the dancers leave?
What time do you get out
I could be done now, I was just studying why
Oh I thought you had to work till five thirty or so...
I didn't take a lunch today
I didn't realize that was a choice
Yeah I just need to plan out the day to do so
Darn I would have gone home and then switched you with now we're both stuck till like 8 o ckock
You should go see a movie or something
4:30 is the earliest I can possible get out
No I'm gong to study I think unless you're free
But I think you said you have teacher conferences
Yes I thought I had a meeting too oh well I miss you
I'm done for the night
Will you please pick up.a little ceasaer pizza on the way home. Kids want pizza in their lunch in fridays
Yes
Also parents are taking kids overnight Sunday to Monday do you have labor day off
Yes
So maybe we could go do something
Yes...we need to go to the house one day and I need to get to dmv to change address at some point.
Yeah you can do that online
But maybe we could divide and conquer a bit on Saturday...it's also the last weekend we have zoo passes
Oh cool ok
I just updated address if Bank of America email s you it was just me
Yeah our physical address is updated except on your CC at boa
Right done now and dmv
Are you mad at me
Awesome
Great job
No
Ok
Are you less stressed
Kinda
Can I do something for you
No I'll be fine...what do you want for dinner?
Mexcan?
Let me see what I have at home?
I'm really open to anything
I'm gonna stop by Walmart tonight if you want me to pick up anything
Ok I'll let you know
I finally got the ball rolling on this iep testing
Awesome I made italisn grilled checken add what you want to that
ok sounds good
I think maybe I am sick I slept great last night and I still feel exhausted
maybe that's sorta how I feel.  I think all the transitions are just exhausting
Maybe. I feel bad because I want to have a great weekend with you and the kids
yeah life is just crazy right now.  I do think it will feel better when we are out of the rectory
Yeah...we definitely need to make that happen this weekend
yeah I think we can do that
and then we can turn over the keys and stop paying the bills on that property
Yes!!!
I want to be done with the rectory but I do hope we can spend some time together as well.  I feel like we haven't really had a chance to talk in forever
I know I think we should set aside Sunday evening and Monday morning just for us...you can do the rectory on Saturday I'll take the kids then Sunday I'll do the rectory (whatever's still not done) and you take kids. Monday we can chill for the afternoon together before another full week.
yeah but I think at some piont we will both need to be there to move the furniture and whatnot out to the street
or at least to the garage
Ok do you think that needs to be done first?
possible just so we know what needs to be done.... what if you come and drop me off and then I'll take the motorcycle home
Good idea we can go with you in the morning and maybe head to jicp to swim etc. That way if you need us again we are right there.
ok I don't want you to not be able to have fun though
I think we will just do water parks I'm not sure I can get to the zoo this weekend unless we all go Monday...that's a lot though
apparently there is an 800 number I can call for when I get sick to talk to ta doctor over the phone
24/7
Cool. We need to find an in network pediatrician or better yet family Dr so you can all just don't same one
that could be good
I would like to give half of what's left over from our pledge to Porter gaud since this is my worship community and half to whatever church we find. Do you have any idea how much that is?
Is that ok with you?
that's fine
Are there vitatops at Walmart
Those msgs were from last night
Oh ok
I won't know how much we have left on our pledge until I see the checkbook
Your HSA card came in the mail last night btw
Awesome. Ok well. We can figure it out this weekend they want the giving soon.
Ok
I'm so annoyed right now we are going back to single gender groups
why? who made that decision?
Hutson
And Charles I think I'm out they can figure it out this n their own
well you have said your piece to everyone so it if goes sideways its not your problem
Except he wants me to run the girks portion
you can still run it the same whether it is co-ed or not and let them do whatever they want to do with their groups
it some ways this could be good for you because it gives you a way to protect the girls from hudson
so i'm not sure how this is but you make a crap load more at porter gaud than I did at st james
Oh really?
i made 2066 and you make 3626
i'm not make that much anymore cause they are taking out my taxes (which church work doesn't) and then I have healthcare costs again
Right but we didn't pay for a house with yours
oh right good point
what is your plan for after school?
Swim then movie
What is your dinner plan?
I don't have a plan but I guess I could do that meatloaf with a salad f that works
I'm not going to eat I don't feel good so can you fend for yourself?
Yes I'll figure out food you should go to bed early with kids
We're going swimming
Ok I'm heading home after I fill the car
the IEP ppl just called for my first appointment
they said the doctor's appointment will be covered by insurance but the testing won't
Ok... Whatever it should go twd deductible
i'll ask
Either way you have to have it so...
yeah I think it will make a huge difference so it will be worth it
Today I got up late forgot I was snack person and have been running around all morning
I suck
no, I think everyone feels a little out of sorts today
jude and josh were off their game, we were almost late to the bus cus I couldn't get my stuff together, and it seemed like traffic was extra heavy today
Yeah crazy Tuesday start
After a crazy weekend
speaking of crazy starts, those serving plates were in my trunk and so I just threw them in the kitchen, i'll put them away when I get home
I had pre-check this morning, court at lunch, and the initial doctor's appointment at 345 today
OMG is your boss ok with all that?
yeah as long as I make up the hours, we aren't busy and he isn't even in today
Oh ok
There are a bunch of kids who look like they are barely old enough to vote that are in here for drug or theft charges with no parents
What day do you need me home early?
I don't
If you get a chance can u call me
It's a no go he has to stay at Drayton this year.
Ok
Bishop Jones just called
Is that good
I don't know
Ok
I want to go in but it's just bad timing
Why don't you find out more but not sign anythibg
Yeah he said he would ask jag if they thought it would be a conflict of interest
Ok
We can talk when you get home I really want you to do it if you can I know you want yo
When you pick up Molly's food can you also pick up freeze dried food just in case?
Yes
Do you want me to see if I can find something pet friendly? It is not
If you could find something that would be better but I don't have a problem sneaking her up
The only pet friendly ones are like motel 8 or days inn...nothing with a pool. So...we will have to figure something else out. Doggie daycare? Drop off with my bro?
Did you know there is a wizard of Oz theme park in Charlotte NC
OMG how could I not know this?
I love you
Good morning! Boys lunches are in the fridge. You should call my dad and see what's up with the bureau deal. You might need the van. Thanks I love you!
Also we can get 10 free bags of sand from bees ferry fire Dept we might want them for those slushy parts around the house. I could go this afternoon if we do.
Do you need this collar?
No thanks though
So there were literally 8 people at my Eucharist this morning 18 for the other chaplains 😕
I don't think you can draw any conclusions about that yet
Ok. I hope I don't suck
Ur a great preacher
Do you want me to get sand bags
Sure I'm not sure if they'll help but we can try
Ok it's messing up my chapel stuff
What is, the storm?
Yeah...are you at work
Just unlocked my door, why
You tube uptown passive can I teach this to the kids for chapel
Uptown passover
That's r ridiculous
So no then...I think it's fun
Do you think the Jews would find it offensive
It is funny but I don't know how sensitive ppl are there
Can you ask your principal?
Yeah but they can't act out slaughtering a lamb
Oh maybe I didn't make it that far
I don't see a problem with that though
No I mean I have to do passover but I can't really have them act it out
How old are the kids?
1st thru 4th
I trust you but I don't see the problem with talking about the lamb
I found something else perfect
Oh great
Have you transferred your license yet?
Like drivers license yes
Canonical no
yeah drivers license, do you have the new one yet?
and the registration?
No
Why
I'm going to need them for this 4% thing
No
Oh ok they are on the way
the girl I share an office with just got her clearance
That's good right there
School district s cancelled tomorrow wondering if Charlotte is far enough
just talked to Bryan and he said I'm free to go but i'll probably have to telework
if we wanted we could probably all go to my parents house they aren't even there
That's a trek
yeah but we would be clear of the storm for sure
and you said you wanted to go to oz....
We will talk tonight
No brain balance tonight they cancelled
that's good right?
did you say school was cancelled tomorrow?
I just feel bad he misses a lot
Yes
he's not missing if they are closed
do you have to work tomorrow?
No
Bryan says I can take any time I need
he's teaching a class in the morning so I might come in for that and then leave after that
Are we screwing the curch if we give back the key so they don't have insurance on the house?
My dad decided he doesn't want any of it so I think you can just drop the key
We owe 11k on the van
Ok
We never insured the house
Ok
Ppl are driving like idiots today
Keys dropped off I'm going to discontinue utilities tomorrow
Chris is leaving town right now
Oh WOW
I'm a stress ball I need to go workout when u get home
I'm not ok
I know, I'm headed home right now

You're welcome
Awesome, you're the bestest
I think I'm going to go to clean eatz and get some more meals if we decide to go they can come with
But we have nothing for the next couple of days
Ok, I was thinking about picking a pizza up for us tonight
Ok whatever you want to do
would you like that or would that not be helpful?
I just was thinking if we have to go we will be eating out a lot so...but looks like we might not even need to go so whatever
i just know that you have been doing a lot and that a full day with the kids is a lot so I was thinking it would be nice to not make dinner
Let's see how the day goes
Do I need to come rescue you?
No I'm good
I can come home and give you a break if you like
Abby's here I'm good
Oh cool
I was going to.order pizza it would be 24 dollars I think we should eat from the freezer in case power goes out ok?
Ok
What if we go to Myrtle beach tomorrow just overnight then ride out the storm at home after that
Dunes is only 119 per night

Hey what's up
Kids have dentist appt tomorrow
I cancelled we are switching dentists
They charged me 90 dollars for late cancellation
ok, why are we switching?
cause they are in mt p
Yes and they are not in network with MetLife
Kids planet dentist is in network in West Ashley so...
do you want me to continue to take them?
I think I can take sick time to do it
No it's ok I got it after school maybe if Jude needs teeth pulled but I got the regular check ups
ok
let me know if you change your mind
Today I found out that bryce and hutson have been completely leaving me out of their planning too!
I'm the red headed step child and I don't know why...
well hudson doesn't like you because you're not a pedophile and bryce is so go with the flow i'm not sure that he would make a stink about anything
They didn't even tell me there's no lunch during vestry anymore
good news, hudson will be gone after this year
True hey how do I get the red stripe off from.aroind my phone
What time do you think you'll be home
730 ish
Why?
Trying to figure out when I need to get home
I love you
I love you too hopefully we can get sometime in the midst of our crazy lives to catch up
Have you seen our checkbook
Not sure I haven't seen it
My head might explode.... Do I g this testing after a day of studying was not a good idea
Sorry
It will be fine
I'm here
I'm stuck in traffic
No worries I'm right at the front door you can pull up front and take your keys and I'll park you
What is your bank online id
You're gonna get a text authorization code please send it to me
Do you like them better knowing that they are dunkin ppl
Yes!
That was cool
I mean instead of Krispy Kreme
Yes
Don't forget to order your clean eatz... Thanks for all your doing for the budget
I still have like two hours of work when I get home ....soooo tired
Is there anything you can do for you?
Just tell me I don't suck...
You're amazing
I love you I know you can do this
You look ok.
Hey when you get a chance send me the name of that app.
Which app?
The read me the Bible in a year app
I think it's called daily audio bible
Lol named Josh
Do you know where the boys scooters are?
i have been hanging them in the garage next to the bikes the boys know where they are
Ok thanks. U having a good day?
yeah I knocked out a chapter and they took us out for lunch because one of the girls in the office got engaged
we were walking to lunch I i saw what's his face from black fadora that you love so much
Best part ofy day so far, Bryan told mei get to wear a suit
For what
A networking event in October
Cool are you traveling
My Paul lesson was too rushed
To North Charleston
Bummer, I'm sure it was still fun. It is a lot of info to fit into one class
Dubose just heard awesome things about my class and was very impressed
Yay!!
Can you please pick up clean eatz tonight before 7
I'm not surprised you're a great teacher and an amazing priest it is really just a matter of time
Yes
Do you think you could make a godly play bag for sand it's 150 and I think we can do it for a lot less
the bag? yes I think I can make it for free I think I have some material that I could use how big does it need to be?
Big enough to hold a bunch of sand maybe 3 feet by 2.5 feet
that would be heavy
I know but did you see it online it like folds up and spreads out
oh I see how they do it, I can make that but it will be like 40-50 lbs and about $20
Won't that depend on how much sand I put in...
yeah but the dimensions that you mentioned sound like that weight
one of those bags of sand at lowes is 25lbs and they are about 2'x1'x6"
maybe less
Have I mentioned how much I love you today?
No...how was your day. I love you too
It was good, my head's mush so I'm coming home.
I think some of it is I need to practice studying for this long
Chris is eating lazer's pizza right now
Yeah it's hard...come home.
Asshole
Totally I hate him more than anyone right now
He didn't even offer to bring us one
I guess they drove there from Nashville
Oh wow
Did you listen to the Daily Audio Bible on the 18th
Yes
I thought Brian did a good job with the sermon that day
Yeah I don't usually listen to the sermons but that was good
Sometimes he doesn't even do sermons
How is your workout
Putting kids to bed
I know we have no money but they won't give me a dehumidifier so may I buy a small air purifier
An air purifier won't help, you should get a real dehumidifier and keep your door shut so it actually works
If you want I can try to find something
No I can do it. I can't believe they said no
I found one on sale for 35 ok?
😪
Sorry I had a meeting
Did you buy it?
The company event this quarter is probably going to be a hocky game. Do you think the kids can go? It would start at 7
Yes
What about the game
Yes I bought it yes to the game if they don't stay the whole time. Going to class now
K
The hby 5k is this weekend
Hamby
I know....I was planning on doing it but now my brothers coming and you have to study so..
Well I was going to try and make it happen, it is important to them and I don't want to lose them as friends
Ok what time?
You should sign your brother and Jen up
I can't even think I'm so exhausted.
Lol
I don't know if they are coming to tell is they got the job or their moving to Florida weird
Whatever
It's at 9
In Mt p
Ok...where in Mt p
Jude has brain balance you want me to cancel
Palmetto island Park
No
What time
930 you could take josh and Jude and I could miss if you want
Ok maybe that will work, we can meet up for lunch
Maybe the Baylor will do something. You should go to bed with the boys tonight
How did your class go?
Fine...I have this whole play to write by tomorrow..and Josh's teacher is sending home more homework I'm failing everywhere today
You want me to work with Josh on homework
You're not failing anything you just have a lot going on
No I can make it happen I'm just frustrated he's got homework after all the hours in school
Yeah totally stupid to give homework to a kindergartener
When you get a sec give me a call
Can you please pick up boys pizzw
I think the transmission is about to go in the Altima
Yeah we need to get you a car I think just with all the travel you'll need more than a motorcycle that car is a 2003
14 years old
I think we can fix it
How much though?
I'm texting Charlie now
I'm guessing maybe a grand or two
2008 convertible with 44000 miles 9998 car max just saying we could both take that out on date night
I think that would be fun to have manual Mini Cooper Sport convertible
2009 14,000 and 14000 miles if we sold the bike we could probably swing it
No then? Lol
I'm not ready to give up my motorcycle and I think we can get the Nissan fixed for a lot less. Charlie said it might just need more transmission fluid
Ok
I got my dismissary letter from the diocese today...it's making me a little homesick and now we have no money and car payment s I feel like I'll never get to go back
I'm not sure how all those are connected but I think you are just feeling low and overwhelmed cuz you're on the edge of being sick
Charlie only works m-f
Ok so...
I just need to figure out how to make that work
We can drop off Sunday night pick up one eveninh
Awaken sent me a text, they said we get a chick fill a card for coming on Sunday
Lol ridiculous
I'm a little curious how much we can get out of them....
You are awful
Probably
You're working late tonight right?
That was my plan unfortunately
Ok love you
Love u
Jude's almost out do we have a plan?
Jens coming over at1130 and I'm.sick like throwing up so...
Where are you now
Im home I'm feeling a bit better but would love some diet gingerale and I have chicken filet for kids
K
I got lunch and ginger ale for you
Thank you
There's literally not a single car here
Maybe it flooded they said that happens
Good point there are a lot of dumpster s
Sorry
They are meeting at the high school
Who?
I don't think that was meant for me
Who is meeting at the high school
Oh, I sent that at church I meant crosstowne
Oh I just got it weird
Wait till you see the styles the boys picked out.
Ketchup, grandma shakes, 3 sets of juice boxes fruitbles,
Jan said that granted Meredith have dentist appointments this afternoon
Ok good to know
I'm sorry for my bad mood this morning. I just feel like I'm trying so hard and it never seems to be enough
you are doing a great job.  Josh's temptations with consumerism are not an indication of your worth as a parent or a person
Thank you
make sure you remind him tonight that if he comes out of his room for anything other than the bathroom before we come to get him then he's coming to workout with me.
Ok
I think a reminder tonight will be enough of an incentive to keep him in his room
i'm going to be stopping by walmart tonight if you need anything.  I can pick up the sand too if you want
If you would pick up the sand that would be incredible. I still can't eat so I know I'm probably over emotional from that
ok
We got your second pay check, it's the exact same amt
Ok they must have pd me for all of Aug. Is that bad
?
I'm so stressed about money right now
No you just said you weren't sure
Ok
We will be ok, I have a plan
Ok...is it just because we are 5000 behind or do we in general not make enough
It's the 5k but while we have plenty of money I'm not sure we are being very efficient with our resources
Don't stress we are fine
I just need to eat I'll be ok
How was the toast last night?
Ok how was your birthday party
Good I ended up get ng a burger which I didn't want to do but oh well
Was it good?
I had a great time with the guys and Chris's friend couldn't stop talking about how awesome Lazer was
Ehhh it wasn't twice as good as Sonic....
Lol that's good I love you
My ankle still feels stiff
I bet
I tried eating bad idea
Brat
What did you try to eat
A bread sticks and yogurt
Yogurt was definitely not good did the bread sticks have garlic and butter
No
I'm sorry I know what you mean about being hungry bt scared of food
Yeah I just feel flight I can't remember words etc
Yeah
Thank you for leaving the house so nice
I made jumbalaya for dinner
Sounds delicious
I'm getting ready to stop by Walmart to pick up juice grandma shakes and your ass and is there anything else you can think of that you want?
Jude's grandma's shakes*
Hamburger buns, diet gingerale, chicken soup
K
I got all the parts for your sand bag
The guy even gave me the sand for free
Awesome
Still sick but this time it took a full hour till I puked my guts out...progress?
Awww poor bean. Get some rest and lock your door I hope you feel better tomorrow
I hate my life
It will feel better when you can eat without throwing up
Hey sorry I couldn't talk this morning but mornings are kinda crazy until about 740
are you feeling better today?
Yes but now I'm two days behind
well don't push too hard and get sick again, you'll catch up don't worry
PS andrea said that she would take the kids for the half day if we wanted cause she's taking a half day for her kids
Kids eat free with an adult meal
Sweet you should get something
I did
Nice
I checked out the google drive thing and it isn't  really that big of a deal.  It is only the desktop app that is going to be effected'
Oh ok
how are you feeling today?
I'm ok...today was crazy and I just feel full of self doubt. But I'm going to.do a light workout after school I think it will really help
You?
we should swap out the couch in the playroom for a futon
i'm ok but exhausted
oh, ps i'll lean up all the sewing stuff in the kitchen when I get home you can just leave it
Where do you think I can get mahtza bread
depends. how soon do you need it?
Tomorrow
um you can make it or you can get some pita bread
you might be able to get it at that international store on 61?
i doubt you'll find it in an international aisle of a grocery store
Google is saying target
st james special order theirs but they were working in bigger quantities
i guess its worth a try but I'd be surprised
Ok thanks
I said something intelligent in front of the whole staff today
just don't let it happen again or they might think you should be in charge
what did you say?
Too long to type it was very chaplain y
I'm trying to think of things I'm.doing well
good job i'm proud of you for doing such a great job!  I could see you changing that whole program around.
ummm how about everything pretty much
Thanks I'm just in my head today
I love you
I love you too
Jude's progress report is not awesome I'm.kinda pissed because I feel like teacher doesn't communicate
Yeah I'd ask her what's up
I asked for a conference...this is what I mean though I can't sleep because I feel like the second I get home a whole new set of problems begins
I understand but you have to let tomorrow problems wait til tomorrow sometime
I know
I am very nervous about going away this weekend are you ok.with the boys?
It's gonna be great don't stress
Ok thanks
it will be good for me to get to spend some time with the boys I think we can really have fun with it
don't worry we will be fine... I'll even feed them while you're gone
Lol
you know you have a show friday right?
Boys need two dollars each for kona ice tomorrow
ok
Are you out?
I just got out why
Nothing forget it
Today's national coffee day, there's gotta be a free cup for you somewhere
Right!
I just got in trouble for skipping a carpool duty I didn't skip it was via email.so evenore annoying
Email them back and tell them that
They may cancel the show tonight pray for that ok?
totally it would be good if you could get to bed at a normal time.  Let me know if I should be waiting for you or not.
Ok
our first event will be a stingrays game on sunday nov 5 at 3.  You and the boys want to come?
Sure unless it's easier for you if we don't either way
no you should come if you think you're able
Sure it's convention weekend but we will be back by then
when's convention?
Friday and Saturday Hilton Head I'm.bringing the boys with me
i knew you were going to bring the boys I just didn't catch that that was nov 5th
ok
or 3-4th I guess
Yeah sorry
that's ok
I cried my face off today and now I have the worst headache
what was wrong with your face that you had to cry it off?
i think it's a nice face, a fine face indeed that anyone would want really
I just got overwhelmed I'm.fine now hopefully no show that would really help
If I have no show that is
i think I told you that I'm in charge of outreach at the office.  we had our first thing, it was collecting diapers for national diaper awareness week.  it went really well
we got over 1,000 diapers which I think is impressive for an office of nine in which only two have children and only one has a child in diapers
and we only collected for 4 days
Wow
I mean I know that it's not a huge deal but I'm proud of them
Definitely
I got a job offer today I want to think strongly about
?
did you just get a job?
didn't*
It's to sing in a choir on Sundays
oh yeah there's some good money there
like everyone pays for their choir basically
which church?
Lutheran Church downtown
I could pay for my voices lessons plus somw
hmmm you want me to ask chris for the scoop on them?
I know the scoop it's all pg people
you talking st matthew's?
St John's
oh
I just want to think about it
i think it could be fine we can talk about it
i do want you to try crosstowne at some point, I liked it
Ok
it may be moot if you are getting paid to be somewhere else but still.
bryan said that he went on his anniversary vacation to st augustines and thought, maybe we should just buy a condo down here rather than having a child
lol
Lol
he was smiling but he said, "no seriously though"
Sounds like he's on the right track
lol
i'm sure he'll have the baby but he's gonna kick himself for not taking the condo.....
Yes!! Warn him warn him now
so to show or not to show?
Haven't heard yet he said by 5 we'd know
k
Show cancelled
that's great
do you have thoughts on when I should get home or anything?
No not really just let me know what you decide.
I'm leaving work now. I will be home after I stop by Walmart to pick up these few things
I need a big container of beads and something to string them on
What sort of beads

I love you
I'm grateful that we're married, can't wait to see you today

Can you pick up the cheapest package of chicken you can find, no more than 2lbs
Yes
Don't forget I need receipt s
Receipts for what
Walmart and Target esp. I'm trying to keep a budget
It's hard to tell if Walmart is clothes or books or groceries
Oh ok
Interestingly, the other boys momhas already talked to fred
Oh really about what was Jude being mean too ? Is he switching it
Julie needs me for a meeting. Talk to you later I love you even though I'm a mess
You're not a mess you just have a lot on your plate
I love you hope you're having a great day!
Just got out of teacher meeting
Was it ok?
I might be able to get home early


Give me a call when u get a chamce
how are you doing?
did you make it through your day without dying?
Yes
i had a bit of a crazy day
bryan wanted us to go to an open house for this professional organization and I had a doc appt for my iep results
Oh no
btw I have a couple of  tentative travel dates.  They are contingent on when I get my security clearance but just so you know they are on the shared calendar (one in Oct and one in Nov)
Wow you are away for 12 days in Nov!
he said it could be up to that much but likely not.  he was pretty vague on that date.  he was like it could be the whole time or just one of those weeks or maybe just a could days once or twice during those weeks
Ok nbd either way
of course all those dates are contingent on when I get my security clearance
Right
I found out today Charles spends a bulk of his time writing articles to be published not on pg stuff
of course he does
Exactly
that's what you get when you hire a doctor with no parish experience
Yep
btw I think if his doctorate is in ministry it is a DD not a DMIN because you have to have parish time in order to qualify, at least at trinity you do
sometimes its a doctorate in philosophy especial in european schools
Can I go workout when you get home I'm getting fat
you're not getting fat but yes you can i'll come home early
Just by 8
i'm headed home shortly.  I'm gonna stop on the way to get molly's food and drop off dry cleaning
hey do you have plans for tonight?
Brandon's having a little get together to celebrate his graduation
No you can totally go
You guys want to go too? You are always talking about how you wish you had more friends this could be a great place to start
When where
Red ice out on Seabrook
Kids welcome?
Starts at 6 we can leave by 8 and it's friday
I think they can come
He said "all are invited"
PS do we want to maybe take the day or half a day even on Monday and do Boone hall?
I can't Monday
Oh bummer
Unless I call in aick but kids have school so...
CAN you ask Brandon if it's kid friendly please
Yeah I was just gonna pull them out of school for the day
I mean if you want to do that and take them it's fine with me
I don't want to leave you out I know how much you live that we can do it some other time
Brandon said they were def invited
Ok what time?
6
Well give them baths and a snack and then we can go till 8
Ok
Actually can we play it by ear
I'm.having a really rough day
Ok, I just thought being around friends might help
But no pressure either way
I don't really have friends
They want to be your friends
Ok verdict is yes but you drive I drink
Lol, ok
And fries I need fries
Would those be loaded fries?
Yes
The mediation is only on the Federal case not the main case
They are trying to do both
from what i'm looking at it doesn't appear that way
it looks like both sides have submitted new stuff  to feed the fire as it were
Yeah a judge asked them to try and do both but not mandatory
So when r u coming home
i can leave in 15
Ok and what's the weekend plan I'm exhausted
ummm sleep?
I don't know that we have a plan but it sounded last night like there were a bazillion  options so we can let the boys choose
if you want we can split the day tomorrow 
No it's ok I got it
Call me when u can
We're headed home now
Ok great did you have fun?
Yes, I'm glad we went
Good
Brandon said I've always going for TCBY if you think that's a good idea. I said I didn't think we would do it
Just was asking about you by the way
Whatever you want is fine
I think we are want to be home with you
Ok
There's a Starbucks on Jill now
The new Exodus is called covenant
Ok that's good
Hey we're going for a walk we'll be back around 1230-1
Ok im not sure where I should be but this is not it
Netflix password?
48UvGW6hY4Z7gzs!
Aced my observation
Of course you did he has no idea how to teach or relate to other humans and you are a good teacher and a great priest
Call me when u can
Do you want me to make you a burger too
Yes please I'm sick again I hate first year germs
That sucks
Is there anything I can do?
Perhaps you would like to eat something else
No it's just a bad cold
Ok
Let me know when ur on ur way
Ok
I'll probably try to go to bed with the boys
How far out are you guys
I don't think Jude needs to be picked up early
They are running around the house
I just finished chapel I'm feeling much better
Good
Don't forget the things you are doing well but think less on the things you don't like about your job
Phillipians 4:8-9
are you feeling better being home?
Yes
good I love you and I know that you are great and anyone that doesn't see that is just missing their grasp on reality
I also called Amanda I think I need to get some help
yeah I know it helps to talk it out
Great news! I just found out that most ppl that get divorced do so around 8 yrs so we made it
We have a problem that I have 2 solutions for but I want to talk about which you wouldprefer
So Worcester screwed up my transcripts and discontinued the program
What does that mean
They don't have a bunch of classes on here that I took and no one can help me
Does that mean they won't let you test?
Saralyn can drive me home tonight
No I can sit with 120hrs which I have but I may not be able to be certified without the extra classes
That's great I can work from home tomorrow and maybe you could take me downtown when you get home from work
Hmmmm did you call the registrar
Why?
Yes and they are playing hot potato with the continuing education department
Oh ok
Cause if I take they boys home in your car and saralynn drops you off my bike will stay here overnight
Why would you not just take motorcycle to work tomorrow
Yeah that's not going to work when do we get the car back?
I could possible call Charlie and tell him I need the car for the night
He called yesterday and said the car wasn't doing it for him so he was going to give it a closer look today
Oh...maybe we need to borrow my mom's car after all....could you pick it up after work and meet me downtown with it. I have a show tomorrow night too
Yeah do you want me to call and ask?
Call my dad yes please
ok good news, the car is ready to be picked up and charlie is only going to charge 60 bucks
Awesome! What was wrong?
So what's the plan for getting the car?
he explained it and i pretended to understand
Right
the long and the short was that there was a part that was dirty and he cleaned it but he said it will eventually need to be replaced which nissan will have to do
Ok. So why don't you call my dad and see if he can take you to pick up the car tonight after kids get home at 7 I'll just be late for show tonight and we will have the car back.
so I found out that "accounting credits" include economics, finance, and marketing classes so I have double my credits to achieve my cpa
as I'm looking at it, it is possible that even with the credits that they left off I won't have enough accounting classes because I went to school based on the MA requirements rather than the SC requirements
i don't know one bridge at a time I have enough to sit which is what matters right now.
Ok I'm.sorry it's so difficult
I just read it again and it says 36 in accounting and another 36 in business so I more than pass the business requirements but it is possible that I won't pass the accounting portion
but it says all i need is 120 hrs to sit which is good the classes can be tomorrow's problem
Ok
So what is the plan for tonight then
the plan for tonight is that I'll leave around 4:30 to pick up the car be back here to meet you around 6:30 get everyone home and then get back in the car to pick up my bike and get the boys in bed by 8
How r u going to pick up your bike with the boys
your dad is going to meet us at the house
Is he going to get the car with you too
no, he'll just meet us at our house around 7ish
How r u going to pick up the car?
i'm going to drive there with my bike and leave my bike on the road
Oh
Ok so I'm meeting you at home as close to 630 as possible?
leave work at 4:30 to get car with bike, get boys with the car at 6-6:30, everyone's home by 7ish, your dad meets us at the house to drive me to get the bike and bring it home he keeps the boys in the van with him
no i'm meeting you downtown at 6:30 and you are driving your car home
Ok whatever sounds like you got it so I meet you at black fedora after brain balance?
yes
sorry it is so crazy
Daryl just added three more rehearsals yo my schedule so I now have 9 basically that cuts my pay in half since I only do 10 shows and we don't get pd for rehearsals
that's ridiculous I'd call him out and be like why are we going to rehearse 9 times for a show with only 10 showings?
This is why I've been wanting to quit you can't question him about it
I'm at black fadora whenever you get here
I am tired but I also had a hard meeting about Jude. I carry a lot for our family
I know you do and I appreciate it
What was the meeting about
Progress report he needs three more months probably with no break and we have no money and I'm tired of it.
We can use my HSA it will be fine
Going home to take a nap
Good
good news, I can get this 4% tax situation figured out without you having to come down but I need to get it figured out this week otherwise I have to go up to N.CHS to do it.
Ok
do you have the correct address on your voter registration card and drivers license?
Yes
Did you pay for dry cleaning already

Ok
i just dropped off, he didn't even give me a slip but it was three pairs of slacks
Ok
I got it
Mr. Fred had a death in the family if you want to pass it on to Andrea
The boys told me that they have Friday off, I can take them on Friday I just need to know so I can flex my hours a bit
They have a half day Thursday too but I have it figured out. Although if you could forward Thursday that would be great
Even just 130 till 4 when I get home
I can do the half day thursday
Ok. Thanks.
i think thursday would be easier for me to work from home
Can u call me
Ill be home by 8
K, I'll try to be home around the same time
You good to get kids I'm about to go into a class observation so you won't be able to get a hold of me
We're at the park at the rec center
Ok how's Josh
What time should be be leaving
I'll be home in 15
You have to leave at 445
Do you want chilli or hamburgers
Hamburger
Good me too
So basically I'm a good teacher but my theology is questionable
Says my Jewish principal
Lol, what?
I taught Exodus because it's the first story in the desert. I said people of God instead of Jewish people. I didn't talk about all ten plagues.
But my classroom management is amazing
It sounds like she wanted you to be more Jewish
Basically
When no one is happy that is the definition of compromise
This is hard.
I bet but if you are a good teacher and you love the kids I think that is the most important part
Do you still love me after all these years
I love you more each day
Me too. How about I show you tonight 😘😘
I like that idea I'll come home early
Hope your having a great day
What do you want for dinner
I don't know do you have thoughts?
What if I stopped at Wal-Mart and got Chinese
The kids want pizza I don't really have anything in mind
Ok you want me to pick up little Caesars
What time you coming home
Soon
Then yes please
I'm not sure that answers the question of what we are going to eat though
Yeah I don't know.
I can pick something up
What if I picked up chicken fajitas stuff from Walmart
https://www.fitsnews.com/2017/10/21/porter-gaud-sex-abuse-was-the-past-a-prologue/
And one of my students mom died last night
Wow that's a crazy day
Did you read that article? It makes me really nervous
Is that talking about bryan
Yes
Good news you aren't in charge of anything and you have always followed safe church
Yeah I hope he hasn't actually done anything dear lord
It is debose and Charlie's problem to get out in front of
I think the school needs to investigate, if true publically denounce Brian, and ask kids to come forward. I also think the chaplains need to have a service of repentance and spiritual cleansing of that spirit of lust and indecency
Yes
They'll be so much mistrust of chaplains will I be able to do any effective ministry this year.
Bishop Lawrence says he is aware of the development...
I'm sure.
So I'm going to Houston they want me to pay for the tickets and use them later we can't do that right now.
I love u hope ur having a great day
Today a boy pretended to rape a teddy bear in a room full of girls so yeah that happened
Did you send him to the to the office
Yeah
Morgan is eating her leftover Chipotle...
I mean if you want to cook tonight I wouldn't say no
I can cook I just wasn't planning be home early
Lol I just meant pick up Chipotle
I don't want to go tomorrow
I know
Once you are there I think it will be good to meet your mentor and to talk to other chaplains
I'm sure there will be a lot of ppl and you won't even have to talk to charles
I just feel too tired to meet new people too insecure
do you think you might be able to take some time at the conference, maybe go to bed early or take some time in the middle of the day to just veg with some netflix?
ps-you should download several episodes of netflix for the flight
Good idea
We have tons of leftovers so ...
yeah it was my plan to eat leftovers or perhaps make a salad for dinner
don't worry about cooking
Ok
Does the company pay for the flight?
I'm pretty sure
We are like jet setters
Totally
It's a pretty great job, they are good to their employees
That's great
I hate security
Me too
How's the hotel?
I'll let you know hour time difference just got off the plane
It's not terrible lol
When are the kid's supposed to be here?
350 ish
Oh crap I'm way early

You're not letting anyone down everything's fine, I have the kids and we are getting a snack right now. You should just enjoy yourself this weekend
Ok

Socrates says: "Be nicer than necessary to everyone you meet. Everyone is fighting some kind of battle."

I thought it was a good one today
Ok
in order to get my passport renewed it is going to cost about $200
Oh god really I thought it was free
I know, I knew it was something but I thought it was more like 30 bucks. I'm thinking about holding off until next month
It doesn't really matter we just need to mark it for nov. I mean Dec is going to be hard too
i'll take it out of the investment money
No it's fine we have 1000 dollars for this reason
The dentist won't see josh because of his chapped mouth
So I got out of work...
that's stupid
do they think it is contagious or something?
She was like you need to take him to the Dr
Whatever
did you say we did, its you
I told her he saw the nurse who said it was fine. They better not charge me
I need a day off
I don't think they can charge you for if they don't actually do anything
what did they say about Jude?
Missed appointment fee
Nothing yet hes still in there
you didn't miss they refused to see you
I'm doing the best I can
you didn't do anything wrong
They didn't charge me no cavities for Jude and they take my insurance so it was free
does that feel better?
Yes
what did they say about the discoloration in judes teeth?
Nothing
I'm bummed that I won't be going out trick r treating with you guys
I'm sorry
Did you want us to wait for you?
no
Ok
it just sucks to miss family things
nothing that can be done, it will be fine
I love you
I love you too
take pictures :)
Ok
Are you guys still out?
Coming home now Molly hasn't eaten
K
hope you are having a good day and that you get to go home early and rest
Yes I got in trouble this morning I need a break
for what?
Me neither but thank you for your amazing insight
Sorry I was texting insight
I'm here eating
I feel like we got in trouble we should maybe at least touch base
?
Ahhh call me when u get a sec I'm leaving now
Apparently, the nurse is saying josh does need to see Dr now. My parents are taking him to health first because u have rehearsal but between that and Jude's nightmare I need to come home. Snuggle in the couch date night? You can pick the show/ movie
K
When do u want me home?
I don't know😥
What's wrong?
I suck as a wife
No there is just a lot going on
I cant do anything right
You are fine we have a lot going on nbd
Would you like to snuggle on the couch before the kids get home
And do you want me to get dinner?
I'm at rehearsal till 7 or 730
We have tons of food
They said they can only dispense what the perscription is for

what did the nurse say?
I didn't get it till 1 I'm in class till 230
weird I sent it at 8
Nbd I'll have time to catch her today
cool, i'm not stressed
my parents said they didn't want to do the drive to go see me when i'm in DC even though they will make it for doctors and haircuts and everything else....
I'm sorry that sucks
yeah well it's my family right....
I know that doesn't feel good I'm so glad you have learned to love our family differently and know that you belong with us
So apparently neither is an antibiotic it's an antifungal and Anna says use cream see if that works first
Is she sure the pharmacist looked them both up last night
She looked them up
She also said the pharmacist should have known you never give our a 60 day antibiotic
The most people ever take is two weeks
Unless your immune compromised then maybe 3
Can I go to the gym tonight
Yes I'm thinking hard about not staying late tonight
To study I mean
If you need a break they'll be plenty of time this weekend
I'd say leave if you feel done nbd
Yeah I'm almost done and then I can start really digging into the review
Ok
Call me when you leave I started dinner for you
I know you have a lot on your plate and that you are feeling very overwhelmed but can you try to make sure you lock Molly up when you leave the house
Could you try and figure out the foggy door
I have it figured out I'm just waiting on a time when I feel like we can drop the money
Honestly you said you were coming home I thought that meant at five ish I left at 450 I thought it would be fine for an hour.
But it is true I'm not a dog lover and having a dog to take care of is too much for me so...
I do have a show so black fedora 630 ok?
K
I just remembered the time change is this weekend kill me now
its fall back you get an extra hour
If we didn't have children who will be up an hour early for weeks
they are old enough now that we can explain the time change thing to them and tell them not to come out of their rooms until we get them
Yeah it's fine how r u? I remember now why we went away for thanks giving I just need a recharge
yeah i'm having trouble focusing
i started doing work and i keep drifting off
i def need a break from studying
Yeah I wish we could go somewhere just for like two nights
that would be nice
I love you
I love you too
I'm gonna catch a beer with bryan
Tonight?
Actually Bryan paid

Ok love you
There's a figure skater on the ice

Congratulations!!!
I know your excited. I love you

I've asked bryan to get me word about whether I'm going to San Antonio next week or not as soon as possible
Ok
Are you happy
yes, i'm glad that i'm now going to be able to work on the project but now i'm nervous for a whole different reason
i was nervous before because I wasn't helping and now i'm nervous that I won't know what i'm doing but i'm sure i'll learn
You will you're not giving yourself enough credit
I'm bringing home a ton of more for dinner left over from vestry
great!
I'm leaving now
Ok any word on next week

I'm sorry you seemed mad at me this morning.
I wasn't mad you were tired. You always think I'm mad when you are tired
Ok
I am worried however, I think you should take some personal time
Yeah I want to take time next week after convention
Good
I'm sorry that this job isn't making more right now but I'm thinking about ways I can make up the money
No no we're fine. I'm.just nervous about you traveling honestly I'm finally not spiraling down into Oblivion and I'm.scared to be alone a lot
The dunes is $59 a night for Thanksgiving week. I'm thinking of taking the kids for Tuesday to Wed night
Whatever you'd like to do
Not sure how to read that
Let's just talk about it when I get home
Ok you're not mad though right?
No
Ok
Can you call me
We're listening to Michael Jackson and Josh asked if this song was sung by the black Michael Jackson
Oh no lol
This mornings meeting was so bad I literally broke out in hives.
Why were they talking about bryan?
No they just cancelled all vestry meals without even talking to the students first. I was shot down and be little at every protest.
It sounds like they are letting fear rule the ministry there
You love me right
I love you more each day
How's your day going?
How are you?
Can you talk?
In a meeting
Oh
K
I'm out what's up
Can I call?
Yes
All set
I saw Arthur and Louise today.
At the prayer breakfast
No way I wonder why they would be there
It was at the convention center actin of people. I feel like you went one year
Honestly I started to spiral.down but I think I'm doing better because I was able to focus and some out of it pretty quickly
Good I'm glad you are feeling better. Did they try to talk to you?
Oh yeah we talked
sorry
i know they're not your favorite ppl
It's fine...we are doing great! I am so proud of your work. I love being in ministry again.. even if it's a lot to figure out. We are good.
i agree things are better and i think i am much better positioned to actually support the family
Hey I need your travel arrangements asap I have to fill out black Fedora availability and I have a ton Porter-gaud Christmas events
I will be gone 12-17 and 28-12/1
What about the 8th
I need Dec dates you have
I think that's the 8-9. I'll be back by 330-4

What do you mean
well you were making plans so I was wondering if you need me to help out in any way
I'll put stuff in the shared calendar
ok great i'll do whatever you need
So you won't leave till the morning of the 8th right?
yes, but you won't see me Friday morning i leave redic early

Can you call me
Andrea says the women clergy mostly wear skirts can I buy something?
yes
Where are you now?
I'm almost home if you want to give me a list of things that need to get done
I booked the dunes it was 75 with taxes everything I think it's fine. We are being very careful with money and groceries should be less with you traveling so much
Yeah I'll get per diem for this trip but not in DC with the other two trips
Which applies to food
Oh you don't get food covered if you go to DC?
That's weird
No because the home office is in DC so when the contract was bit it was considered local travel even though it isn't local for me
Bid*
Oh ok whatever. I think it's fine still I have to shows in Nov and like ten or more in Dec.
I'll get some overtime too for travel
I was thinking it might be good to use 1000 dollars from our hsa to pay for Jude that would give us 1000 in actual cash from your parents during the holiday season or fo you think that's deceitful?
No that's my plan
Ok cool
Will you pay while I'm gone?
Yeah I think I pay next Tuesday
Ok I'll try to get a number for you in that account
Ok thanks.
I love you
I love you too, I really will miss you

He just said he lost it
Oh ok
Oh well what can you do right
It's fine have fun
Party's over
Was it fun
Everyone seemed to be having fun
Did you
I'm glad he had the event
Lol ok I'll see you soon
I'm exhausted
I get that you had a long weekend, how about I put the kids that bed to night
Nah I want to see them but I'd let you figure out dinner
I love you

Yep my luggage had more room than I did,maybe the could put me under the plane... Lol
Lol
Just got in, I'm drive NG to the hotel now. Love you sleep tight
Good morning call me when you get up
Just sitting around in the cafeteria...
Cafeteria?
Just contemplating my existence lol
On base, they didn't even let me stay in my room
Oh bummer that sucks
The worst part is that I didn't really that was his plan so I didn't bring study material and I forgot my wifi connection so I'm stuck reading endless process statements
Oh god
Sorru
You can use extra data if you need to
I mean it's only 10 dollars and we start fresh today
It's fine hopefully I'll be cleared by lunch
R u around?
What's up
My battery died
It's fine nbd I just needed a pep talk with Jude doing this test
I'm sure t will be ok
Yes
It will either show improvement and we will continue or it won't and we'll try something different
Either way it is not a reflection on you
You are a good mom and it is clear you love your kiddos
Ok
Yeah so I'm spiraling so Kyle is gonna come to dinner ok?
Totally, I'm sorry I'm not there
It's fine I'm catching it early reaching out doing much better really
Good
God loves me, there s a fudruckers a qtr mile from my hotel!!!!
Ummm awesome
Goodnight
Sorry I fell asleep with kids at ,730 goodnight
Oops sorry I didn't meant to wake you, I thought Kyle would still be over
No he left St like 730 but it was good. I was exhausted
Forgot @ the time difference good night, love you
Love you too
Good morning
Morning!
There is one of those cool indoor/outdoor pools here and it lights up blue at night, too bad I didn't bring a suit
Go buy one
No it's not worth the money unless you and the boys were here to enjoy it with me
Are you actually working today
I'm working hard
On my solitaire game..,
JK I'm studying today
Lol
Do you think I can do an advent wreath take home in this setting?
Good night
Call me when you get up
Meeting will they Erin from brain balance went well.
I think we keep going ok with you.
I love you
You too did you have fun
Jude's got a wicked cold and I have no idea how I'm going to get to Josh's Thanksgiving lunch which he is desperate for me to go to.
When's the lunch?
11
Tomorrow
I have lunch duty and then a class at 1130 yes tomorrow.
I thought I could btive him with other fun but he really wants me there
When did they let you know
I've known but with having to take Monday off for Jude it's hard to get coverage
Yeah it sucks but it is kindergarten the Jude thing was more important
We can do something for Josh later
I know
I may be able to find coverage we will see. I'm tired but there's too much on my mind can't sleep
I know you are juggling a lot I'm really proud f you
Sorry I'm not able to be there for you right now
It's ok...it's really been fine. I'm just exhausted by days end
About to walk into Eucharist. Love you
Oh ok love you too
I miss you a lot today.
I miss you too, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed today
Because?
I'm a little out of my depth in everything I'm doing right now
Is it just the language or is it the speed?
It will get easier it's your first one!
Yes
Just make notes of everything you didn't get so you can ask and be ready next time
It is stuff. Don't understand or barely understand coming fast
Gotta go sorry
Praying for you
Would love to check in when you can
Sorry I missed you I'm prolly gonna go out in about an HR for dinner
Did your day get better?
A little
How about you?
I know you must be exhausted
So not really then what happened?
So Chris, one of my bosses, when he came to pick me up yesterday said he wanted me work on something, I thought he was saying from another project but apparently it was writing up the walk through for the first thing we did yesterday which I took horrible notes on and didn't really catch but I can't really say anything cuz everyone else has twice as much work as I because I wasn't there for the first two days
I'm gonna just ask Chris how I can fix the problem tonight. I thought I had some time but I think he may want it finished before I leave tomorrow
Hmmmm...what did you say?
He told me he wanted me to work on this thing and I said sure sounds great
Like work on it meaning it was bad or it's your assignment
It's my assignment
Oh...I read that wrong.
But honestly it is like half the words I hear in a day I don't understand
Do you think if you talked about it with me you could figure it out like auditory processing
They say things like the fill out the 1080 in abacus to process the dd77 which for GFEBS
I'm sorry...do you think your boss here can help
Chris's boss was having all go around and talk about ready so and I said something and then he put this chart of pre identified risks in front of me and said which do you think is the big ggest risk factor
It was like a whole page of words and the whole team was waiting on me to respond
So what did you do?
Shouldn't your boss have been training you for this the last three months?
I finally just picked one and it was fine I guess
He couldn't because it is all sensitive information
Oh god.
I'm sorry
The rational side of me knows that everyone flounders their first yr
But I feel like I don't have anything right now. I'm struggling with the auditing and the governmental stuff and this project specifically
It is just hard to not have anything that I feel like I'm good at right now
It's your first project. Take notes ask questions thank everyone for their understanding and assure them your a quick study. Be polite on time and do the best you can it will be fine.
A large part is that it was a crazy awkward situation to begin with you weren't set up for success that's not on you
Yeah I'll be a lot better at ft detrick
Your good at lots of things this is a big change give yourself some time
Yeah
You will! If you need time next week to figure out all those letters and catch up it's totally fine I want you to feel ready for your next trip
I'm doing a lot f two stepping around what I used to do
Just say you worked with religious non profit
That's what I do
Perfect
I say non profit
And I had one guy dig more and I said religious aide
I think you can say religious or even the church it's fine we are in the south
Cool
I'm about to go out with everyone sorry for dumping on you
Text me goodnight so I know when you are available n bed
I'll call you if you're still up after dinner
It's ok I love you
Ok
Going to bed single parenting is exhausting
I'm sorry we are headed to the hotel now
What happened with Josh's thing
Don't be sorry ...I'm good just tired.
I got there !!!
Ur a super mom
Was he glowing?
He was very happy
Did you have a good dinner
It was good, Texas bbq
Cool
I miss u guys
What time do you get home tomorrow
It's fun to go on these trips but it's hard to be gone
4ish

I need a minute
I won't keep you though you go to bed and call me when you are able tomorrow morning
Ok
Ok totally
I want some daddy time with the kids
I love you, goodnight
Ok love you
Good news, I talked to Chris and he said my project wasn't due tomorrow and the team would have notes I could use, I feel better. Thank you for listening it really helped.
I'm glad. I'm ready for you to come home.
I am ready too, I miss you so much
There is a bunch of fun family stuff to do here al la Myrtle Beach style as a possible destination when I get more sky miles

I thought you were going to be home at 4
I just got in apparently my ticket was made in local time
Oh ok
I should be home by 630
What time is your thing
It's fine I'm just exhausted
I probably can't go now
Why is it because I'm too late
I'm exhausted been with kids all night haven't eaten yet it's not going to happen
It's an HR and 20 wait
Can we do the kids shopping first?
Ok why don't you sign in and we'll meet at old Navy

Josh know s
Do you want me to bring you some soup? Or anything?
You are planning to take Josh to the doc too right? Otherwise I need to be getting him on the bus
Yes
Double ear infection josh is fine. I'm thinking school tomorrow and I pick them up.at carpool to go get you and head to Myrtle what do you think?
Can I use hsa for non perscription drugs what about perscription drugs?
You can use the HSA for anything medical
I think that sounds right and hopefully that will give you a bit of a break
Yeah....I'm feeling a bit better though. I got the Christmas shirts for Jude and if they go to school tomorrow I can do the thanks giving stuff
Plus I splurged and got a Starbucks so...
Andrea needs me resume and I can't find it anywhere kill me now
Where did you put it?
I love you if I knew that I'd know where it is
I mean where was the last place you saw it?
I thought I attached it yo my otm profile but she says no
Now I think that I may have really messed up.my profile which may be why no one ever called me and she needs it all set by 630
It sounds like you are starting to freak out a bit sometimes it helps me to take a small step back and organize my thoughts
Basically I'm stuck until some computer in this house is charged enough for use
Mine can be used just plug it in
It's about 50% I think
Where is yours

I feel like we are a bit disconnected I know you're not mad at me but I don't know how you feel
Honestly we have just had a bunch coming at us lately so I've just been trying to keep my head above water, I'm sorry I haven't been more present to you though
It's ok first year at a new job
I know but it's your first yr too and you have some pretty crappy things happening at your work
Yeah but I'm not going to let it over shadow the awesome ministry I've been doing.
You have been doing great ministry and it's a marathon not a Sprint so I'm confident your day is coming
Yes I love you
I just heard from St Francis they want an interview
I'm excited
Oh wow that was fast
It's definitely a good sign
yeah
That would be great I'm happy for you
It would be great

No I wish we had more time here though...I needed a bigger break
Do you want me to put steaks on?

We have to be there at 1230
OMG look out it's basically all being delivered today!
So I got all the way down to my office and there's no heat
Oh no so what now
I'm driving home
Bummer is everyone leaving
No, there's heating to office so the people that drove from North Charleston and Summerville are staying
I don't think I understand
I need to make it home before my phone conference at 10 though
Did you want any of this dinner
Yes
how's your day going?
Oh you know....hey Josh is going to have b ball on Thursdays from 6 to 7 not sure how to make that work
But I need to
how exciting though that he is starting.  i know he is over the moon about it
He starts this week
yeah it would have been good if they gave us more of a heads up...
Yeah well
How r u
i'm working on this crazy headache but other than that i'm good
Flight ok
i'm actually being productive which is amazing as I have no idea what i'm doing most of the time
possible or it could be the pressure change
Oh yeah that's great I love you.
i have dinner with my mentor tonight which should be nice
Oh good
I didn't know you had a mentor
yeah she's a manager on another project so hopefully she will have an idea of how to succeed and progress
Can you call me before you go to dinner?

Good news I don't think I'll have to pay for dinner any night here
Score!
My principle just brought me into his office and congratulated me on yesterday
Yay!!! I'm so proud of you!
He said he only did it with me cause I'm the only one he thought was ready
That's awesome
Yeah if he thinks that it is all posturing I don't know that I'm more ready than anyone else but I'm glad he thinks that
Yay!!!
Do you think we could find some time to reconnect when I get home
This is my weekend of four shows
I'm sorry I'm doing the best I can
I know you have shows and I appreciate the work you are doing for the family. I didn't mean immediately I just meant sometime soon I'd like to take some time
Yeah I wonder if we could go over night one night during break
That sounds like a great idea let's pound out the details when I get home
Ok
I hope you guys are having fun
Too much to do too little time
Can you call me at some point
I can't sleep and I have four shows this weekend. I just feel like I am not good enough for all that needs me

By the way, if you are looking for an Advent devotional, this is set up to be an Advent Ignatian Retreat.

I wrote one of the entries.  I have signed up for it.  Half in hopes it will be good and I enjoy it.  Half just to see what the other people recruited to contribute wrote.

Something about computer updates or something
What time do you need to leave
They just said another 2hrs to change the part, what time do I need to be there
As long as there are no more delays I should still be able to make it home by 6
Ok I could bring them as long as you get them before 730 start
I landed
I landed

What?!?
Is Bishop Lawrence allowed on campus
Yeah so there's that. Can you be home by 6
I was planning on it
Supposedly not but he's on the board so I don't know how that can be
Why did they make that rule?
Something about the lawsuit
The one that's over?
Or the federal one
The new one I think
Can you call me?
Does that car wash do the underside of your car
Yes
I love you
I love you too

I was planning on going. I need to wash my car at some point because of this flooding downtown
Ok
If I send you my sermon can you read it? Which email if yes
yeah send it to andrew.d.wms
Call me when you get a sec
I sent my sermon please read
I read it my initial impression is that the content is great and quite profound but there are a few typos but as they won't be reading it I guess it doesn't matter
Right...I think ultimately I'm going to give it memorized anyway so you like the content?
i do like the content.  I think it is a message that people need to hear
Tippet and stole same thing right?!
Not exactly, a tippet is the black stole usually with diocesan and academic c patches that is worn for prayer services stolesbare worn for Eucharist
Do you have one?
Yes
Tippet the s worn with cassock and surplus though

Thanks
I'm bringing you home dinner
Leftovers from vestry
Nice I love rich kid leftovers
Yes
One of my vestry girls asked if I would baptize her today. So excited!
That's cool!
You should make a big thing about it at the school inviting students to be a part of the service and what not.  Maybe it could be contagious
Good point
I feed Molly will you please make lunchrs
I'm having the worst panic attack over buying a sweatshirts
They gave me a steroid shot, a antibiotic shot, and a nebulizer
Oh god you need to figure out the allergy thing

Ok
Ur life looks more fun
Lol love you I hope you make it home I'm listening to cancelled flights already
Bryan's wife wasn't able to make it out cuz of the cancelled flights
Bummee
I I have my parents on standby if you can't make it

Getting ready to take off now
Ok love you
Bad news we pulled back into dock and we are getting off the plane

Do you have to leave at 6 or does it start at 6
I have to leave at 6
Good
I'm hopeful I can still make it home by then
Just keep in touch parents are back on standby
I know this is crazy I'm sorry
It's ok not your fault

OMG is this safe?
Yeah I think it is some sort of salt and alcohol mix to keep the ice off the plane
Ok
Take two...
Ok I don't think you'll be here in time if your just leaving
I thinky tippet is probably under the other stores on the hanger
Can't go grocery shopping you have the keys I'll just go when you get back

Well. They seemed thankful
That's nice

It's kinda a slow day
I texted your dad but no response
I want to write my sermon
John the Baptist Advent go
Is it Mark?
John
Oh....
How about John as a sign and symbol of God's leading
Or how the HS prepares a place for us
What did you end up going with?
How was your day
Sounds like you had a productive talk with nick
Good
Yeah it was good
Sorry we didn't get to go to your holiday party
Writing my Christmas sermon and realizing it's my first one pretty awesome
That's awesome! I know it will be great
In truth I think that you mostly wrote a couple of mine over the years
Haha
Lol
I love you
Looks like we might be pulling samples from HI
When do we leave 😉
They just gave me a new office in the lower school
Nice
How's the sermon coming
Done!

I'm awesome

Dubose just gave me grief about the office but what ever

I changed my Tuesday show to Monday so you can help my brother ok?
Ok
I love you
You want us to come home now?
No it's ok let me finish here I'm in the middle of present invitory see you at 1130 or 12
Can't find any of Jude's stuff did I miss a hiding place?!
How r u?
I'm good, you guys have fun?
Yes it was really crowded but beautiful
Cool
Miss you wish I was home

I appreciate all that you do though
Thanks
Turns out this week is going to be crazy too.. teachers mom just died
CAN you call me
Did Jude to his brain balance exercises this morning?
Or brush his teeth?
sorry no I completely forgot.  I'm going to put a reminder in my phone so I don't forget again
If you can just get his teeth brushed that would be good
yeah i remember in the evening it is the morning that sometimes slips
Would you do me a huge favor?
Yes what
I have a treasure chest box for one king but I need two more gift type boxes can you find something
?
Around our house?
Yes please
This is for a school play?
Yes
So stuff will be returned?
Yes
Here's my thought. You have a box, I have a box you can you if you promise not to break it, and then you can use a cruet for the myrrh
Ok cool thanka
Can you leave them out so I don't have e to search in the morning
It will be on the kitchen table
Thanks
In good news saralyn is going yo take my 839 show in Christmas and Daryl gave me a 200 bonus
my manager asked me to draft the next site visit letter and I told him that we should think about looking at hawaii :)
Lol I just did make up on 30 kids in 30 minutes
because you are amazing
i made it to the bus stop before the bus this morning so we all have our own victories
Lol
I'm having a nervous break down because I have to meet with Nick and Charles today. So uncomfortable. Eye twitching panic attack
Just to be noted
apparently one of the options is Alaska....
i might need to review my no snow policy with them
Lol
Can you call me
my meeting for this morning just got pushed to 330-430
Ok it is what it is
they moved it again from 2-3 so we should be good again
Ok
How are you doing?
I'm praying for you today
You working from home?
yes
why
Ok just wondering about internet
let me check my peronal computer
my personal computer is still not connecting so i might need to go take the computer to get checked out 
maybe i messed up a setting or something?
Ok just checking
Working on sermon now
I'm done and ready to take the kids
Bowl with white rice black beans barbacoa lettuce medium green salsa and a little south cream
We're headed back now
Ok me too from grocery
I could use a kind word
What's wrong?
Just a tough night I'm exhausted...nervous about tomorrow
You don't need to be neervous you are a great priest and ppl love you
Your sermon is really great don't stress
Did you read it?
Yeah
Ok you think there ok?
Yes as always your sermon is great
Thanks
Is there anything else you need?
No just to cry
I don't think they have that here, how about I hold you on the couch tonight
Ok
Dear God, the keyboard was a bad idea.....
Can you call me
Can we do Chris and Mike and families this Friday?
Scratch that Chris is out of town till next Thursday but we might be able to do the dearths and the hambys
I have shows the 28th 29th and 30 th
Another reason I'm stressed
We could have them Sunday after church
That would be nice, we don't have to though if it will stress you out
Sounds ok but let's talk tonight
Actually maybe Saturday is better the hambys are still going yo St James and the dearths are tied up on Sundays with their church
What's your eta
I screwed up bad
What Happ
Happened
Hello?
I got in an accident
OMG you ok ? The kids ok?
It wasn't that kind of accident
What do you mean?
I screwed up the side of the can coming out of the garage
Sounds like $2k worth....
Oh ok nbd
It's kinda a big deal
It's a lot of money
We will figure it out I'm just glad you're ok
Please don't text me and say you're in an accident again unless your being transported to the hospital
We should probably just schedule the van a tune up etc for this weekend if possible before school etc.
I'm done whenever you guys want to come home
48UvGW6hY4Z7gzs!
On going to an 11 in Mt pleasant
Ok

Fun I can't get my shit together
Why I think it's fine, sometimes things just don't want to go as planned
What's up in Ferdinand
Don't worry about it, I'll catch you after the movie
I have a reminder on my calendar that we were going to swing kids downtown? Did I put that on the wrong day?
Yes I'm good today
Do we have speakers I can borrow
no, the ones we used at FFF broke towards the end.  I think the only speakers we have left are connected to the computer and frankly those aren't doing so hot
they aren't crazy expensive though and they tend to be a needed thing for ministry
Ok let me think about it
No school tomorrow
yeah I figured... I think I'm going to have to work from home too.  it sounds like there is a good possibility that the bridges will be closed
how was your meeting, are you ok?
No school tomorrow
For me either
Great now you have an answer
When you get home I have an email I want you to read
Ok
So glen McConnell isn't bad but getting there phew
Where r u?
Show just cancelled
Lol
So crazy
And Barbara finally responded to my email that I'll do it but we should meey
Good
My parents are coming at 8 leave a blank check please clean up kitchen
Love you!
Did you take the key to the Nissan?
It's ok I got it figured out
Sorry what did you do?
I'll go in after my morning meetings on my bike
I'm sure my parents would let you take their car
It will be fine I've started work now and I'll leave before dark
I'm so sorry I'm such a screw up
No sweat, I've done it before it's easy to do
What did the plumber say?
They haven't come yet
Bummer
Have you noticed that when they say 9-12 it means they get here at 12 and stay til 2?
Yes. Meeting with he went well. I'm out of doing vestry
that's good right?
were they upset?
I don't think so...Julie wanted it I didn't have to say any harsh words should be fine
are they going to fix anything or are they just removing you from the situation?
Just remove me
how do you feel about that?
It's fine everyones happy I'm all good
good
They still haven't come
I'm sorry so I ordered 80 dollars worth of chic filet and then they asked me to cancel the meeting
Sorry
awesome, i'd still bill it to them
I can't I'm sorry I was never going to bill it
they were like we aren't sure when we can get out to you we didn't even know you had an order so I told them we would find someone else to do it
Ok I'm sorry
Let's celebrate your acceptance with chic filet
Lol
i'm really happy for you
new plan
I just found out that the trip I thought was going to be the 22 is actually being proposed for Feb 5
There may be a different trip that I will be going on the week of jan 22 but we don't know yet
Ok
basically to say it is most likely at this point that I wont go anywhere until feb 5
My manager said that they were thinking of only sending one person on the trip with another team
I mean for the jan 22 trip
Ok whatever is fine with me
Just got called to head masters office
that sounds very official
Can you call me
What's wrong?
Nothing my phone is screwed up
Let me try again try restarting your phone
I tried
Try again
Still no good?
It may just be the weather
Do you want to try calling me
This is crazy
I'm so sad and tired
i just saw your message I was going to ask how you are doing.  I know you must be exhausted
what did the doc say about josh
It's ok...pink eye getting drops now
hopefully he doesn't share with anyone else
Charles never responded to my email. Andrea never responded St Francis never responded I'm getting annoyed
you are like a super mom taking josh to the doctor with everything else on your plate
Thanks
well I think that it is good that Charles never responded
I needed that and thank you for talking last night
everyday that he procrastinates is one extra day that you can say "clearly it isn't that important for him to reconcile"
i find the best way to deal with these things is a steady diet of chocolate and exercise :)
seriously though, I think the best thing to do is to recognize the larger system in play and look for another job.  it was wisdom that you noticed that last night
Yeah
Don't you have meeting today?
Yes
Will you help me work on my resume tonight?
yes
and if you need, feel free to call after the meeting
i get this coming monday off
Me too...maybe over night to Myrtle
that would be good
i think it would help to get away for a couple days
Don't forget Josh's eye drops
I didnt
Thanks
I literally just sit in my office and cry
Nick spread his hate into lower school Jessica won't even look at me. Get me out of here
Who's Jessica?
Lower school teacher who was invited to chaperone over me
Because Nick's an ass
I'm so depressed I'm literally just hiding behind my door in tears what has happened to my life?
Interesting, I'm sure she will see how wonderful you are
I've been praying about your situation and I feel as though it is important that you don't let Charles and Nick's baggage overshadow your good work and God's clear call in your life. Make sure you are listening to God's voice of truth and authority
Now they think I'm a deacon....
Josh doesn't have practice tonight and I didn't get St Francis
they just told you that you didn't get st francis?
Yes
i'm sorry bean how are you doing? 
Let me know if you need to talk after your meeting
I'll be fine. I'm just exhausted
I was right, I can't get out of my FSA until next year
Bummer when r u coming home
Umm about now, I just finished up.
Ok I'm exhausted...I could use some help
I hope to be home in 45
Ok
Hey just leave the kids toys and garage I'll get it ...it was shitty of me to leave it
We're in front of the building
Test
Test
Comi
Test
Do I need to put drops in Josh's eye
Yes last day
K
Love you
Love you too
Have you heard more about Josh's practice?
No so I think don't worry about it
K
You sure?
Yeah I mean it's so last minute and they are tired he has map testing tomorrow so I think it's better not to push it
Ok sounds good
I'll work late then
Okay
My computer is broken and I'm going to have to send it back to headquarters
Morgan just toold me that the all hands meeting is April 13th...
Not sure what that means
Me neither at this point. I'll have to talk to ppl when I get my computer back
It may mean I'll meet you and the kids there on Saturday morning if that could be a possibility? But not if that feels like too much
Is all hands in DC?
Maybe your parents would like us to go there for Easter I have that time off and it might be easier than the wedding
Yeah. That's the thing we were both talking about going to
I'm not sure that's a better option. We've got some time for me to talk to all the players and figure it out
Ok
I think you need to go to the work this g though
No, I agree skipping a mandatory meeting that they pay for the first year is a bad idea I think but in theory I could fly out early the next day and be there before lunch or earlier
Ok
Would you be willing to go up Friday and I'll meet you the following morning?
There is a flight that lands in Charlotte at 7
Probably let me think about it
Would you be willing to look at this cover letter tonight
Yes
Is it for Calvary
Yes
I'm sorry about the all hands meeting. Bryan told me March last week I had no idea
Did you hear anything about the car
No
Strange now that you mention it
Oh ok
I'll call at 5 and check
Thanks
They were supposed to work on it first thing today
What time you coming home?
I just finished for the night
No meeting I got the date wrong we don't meet for two more weeks
That's good right?
Sure
Just called fender bender, they said they just finished the estimate this morning so they wouldn't have had it yesterday anyways
They said around $3200 so we are paying the whole $1000 deductible. With that said I think we should wait on the water heater. What do you think?
Yes but you need to show me how to reset it
I can do that it's easy
Ok
Your son just said "hashtag good habits"
Which son? Lol
Jude
No idea where he got that

My co.puter that was guaranteed by 1030 still isn't here but at least these guys finally came
Thank God
Recycling dude took our big boxes too!!
Yay!!
I think I'm going to take the boys to the basketball game here tonight at 630 just FYI I know you have to work late
Oh ok, I know Josh will love that. Good thinking
Also just sent Calvary app
Lman you are on fire. How do you feel about it
Not sure...a little scared honestly. We have so much going on not sure it's a good idea we shall see
Obviously your over whelmed which means I need to step up but I'm overwhelmed not sure if this is great timing
You don't need to step anything up we are fine
I'm.subbing all morning...
Why are you crying?
I'm not
Oh, I thought you said you were sobbing all morning but you meant substitute teaching?
Yes
They said we work like normal and nothing changes bcof the shutdown
Awesome! I'm feeling very disconnected from you. Everything ok?
Yeah I'm just feeling like things are a bit crazy
Ok...what can I do to help?
Nothing really
Ok how late r u working tonight?
What's your weekend plan?
The longer I work tonight the less I'll have to do tomorrow. I feel like I'd like to spend a couple of hrs with Jude sometime this weekend. I'm going to Josh's game but I want some Judah time too
Ok
I'm headed home
Oc198wilj
There is a ton of turkey stuff left if you don't feel like cooking tonight we can eat that
I don't mind they'll be stuff for tomorrow
Bryan says that we've run out of funding for travel already and that after the trips that are scheduled are over we won't be able to travel until the get an addendum approved
Not sure what that means but ok
It means we tore through a lot of travel money in a short time. It also likely will mean that February and the first part of March will have no travel
Ok
Home in 20 minutes
Ok that will be great I'm just putting the last load of laundry in now
I'm done with everything except flashcards
Ok
If you want I can break here or push through
Push through we are good
Done
On our way home

hey just got off the phone with fender mender and they said wed or thurs
Awesome! Just got off the phone with psychologist. Super hard but good
youre amazing.  I know it was hard to have the call but i think it shows what a good mom you are that you were willing for go through it anyways.
Thanks
What's your plan for tonight
i'll probably work until 7-730 i guess, why
if you need me to be home earlier I can be
No that is fine
Did you figure out what days your going to be late this week cause of big wigs
If you get a chance I'd love a call
Bryan says Wednesday for the big wigs
Ok I was trying to see this show pay what you will oh well
Should I try and skip out, I want you to have down time
No no that's more important
I'm headed home now
Ok drive safe
Can you be home by 8 so I can go take a dance class
yeah I can get home a little earlier today
Today has been rough...this retreat thing is getting annoying
Yeah it sounds annoying but just remember it's temporary
And if everyone is going to be there you can hang out with Bryce
True
hey, they got back to us about the higher ups.  they are definiately coming tomorrow and they want to take everyone out to dinner, spouses included.  you want to come?
I probably should right?
i don't think you have to, its up to you
we can just say the kids had a thing but they are probably going to take us to somewhere amazing.  it might be one of our only chances to go to a nice restaurant in charleston... lol
Why don't you see what others are doing and I'll follow suit
it sounds like it might be a private room at either halls chop house or fig
Ok...if others bring spouse I'll come
I need a dress though
morgan said she was thinking she'd wear black pants a shirt and a cartagon
I don't really have that either ...clergy shirts
right.... can you wear something that you wore to ECMCS?
I can find something but I might have to hit target ok?
yeah, i think this is supposed to be fun I want you to have a good time
go get a shirt if you need a shirt
Ok what time?
stay tune i'm not sure.  I think that the COO is coming around 1 and he'll talk and then they will go look at buildings and I'm not sure how long that will take and then it sounds like drinks and dinner
Ok
Can u call me
Not going to dance tonight so come home whenever
how come?
because of all of this budget/ CR/ gov shutdown stuff they shifted my travel days one day forward so I'm leaving Sunday and coming back thursday
Ok
Hey where do you want to meet up?  I don't want you to have to walk in alone
You tell me I'm not even home to change yet
don't stress we have plenty of time
why don't I meet you at the marion square garage
its like three blocks from there I think
Ok
Ok
I'm here but no rush
Today feels long and it's only 1030
I too am very tired, thank you again for coming with me last night
No problem
Bus is 330 and we leave for bb at 4 right?
445
Do you have the keys to the saab
good news, the van's ready for pickup
Yay
if you go pay after getting the kids then we can pick it up after I get off work
I think I'll just see if my dad can take me to get it
oh ok that makes sense too and then he can take his car back.  good thinking
Great
I know you are getting stressed for time but we are good here and grampas here with me
Take your time and be safe
Almost there
Get a picture frame

Hey, btw you or I need to make our way over to take5 and take your car for an oil change
If you want me to take it Thursday I will
Ok thanks for letting me know
tomorrow is the day that I have to be home early right?
I'm headed home
I'm having really bad chest pains...
The nurse is recommending an ekg
Oh my gosh what's wrong g!
I didn't see your last text
It's ok
I'm going to wait and see how I feel later
Is it anxiety or do you feel sick?
It's not like the anxiety I've had before if that's what it is
It hurts down my arm through my jaw
That sounds serious
Are you sure you don't think you should get the ekg?
I don't know
I think you should go you have had a lot of stress lately and pain down the arm is one of the signs
i just called VTS and they said my transcripts have been sitting on her desk for a week now and will go out today
Bleck annoying
yeah, but not unexpected
did you go to the doctors?
No I feel better
good I'm worried about you.  you need to take care of yourself so you stick around for a while
Can you call me when you get a sec
I'm here in the visitors spot whenever you get here
Love you, hope you're having a good day
Thanks...you too
I know you're not excited about teaching today but at least you're not teaching at ecmcs
True...
What do you think of this? www.seminary.ws/phd-in-clinical-pastoral-counseling/
Ok Ive calmed down a bit
I wrote an email just saying I'd like to have a department discussion about it. His reply was kind so...
That's good. I would encourage you to focus on what breathes life into you. Think about the pastoral counseling thing and your chapels.
They said yes to funding a PhD in pastoral counseling I can start next year
That's great!
That program seems good, do you like it?
Yeah I do...I like the core classes and then you have to take some advanced courses that look really good too!
Great! I that will give you something positive to focus on
I think so.
I just get so pissed when it feels like he's picking on me
For whatever it's worth, I didn't read that ashom picking on you. I saw it as he finally found out you did that work in a way that made him feel/look stupid for not know in about it.
No I know which is annoying. Like own your shit dude I told you it was break and you didn't check the email your bad
I can't sleep
How are you doing this morning? I'm sorry you had trouble sleeping
How has your day been?
I'm good how r u
I miss you and the boys
We miss you too
When is that meeting with Charles about policies
Not till March
Oh good
We just finished up for the day, can I call in a little bit?
Yes
Sorry crazy afternoon
I'm trying so hard and I just don't fit anywhere
Thank you I love you
Call me when you can
I love you and miss you
Miss you too. What Josh great? He was probably not really into it huh
Not really
Lol he's mine
Yes
I would have hated that too
He had fun but it's obviously not his thing
Yeah
I'm exhausted
You should go to bed
I think I will you ok
Yeah I'm about to head to bed too
Ok love you
Ok so tomorrow I either need to stay at school and go to dinner with everyone you pick up kids at 350 or I go home to get kids but need to leave at 5 to be back here
I'll be home to pick up the kids, you go and rub elbows
Ok today I did Eucharist for just Charles and Bryce and now I'm crying my eyes out
I'm sorry I remember how frustrating that is
I don't care about the lack of people I was over the top nervous because it feels so judgey
Yeah but you are above reproach and more knowledgeable than any of them, trust your experience
I'm going to call Dr pullano today she knows my family history and will prescribe something. I'll be fine it might be a little money but we will figure it out right?
hey i left my phone at home so I can't take your call, what's up?
did you call rich?
oh I didn't see your text from earlier, sorry.  Yes go to the doctor if you need
Ok I called her I'm going to get a full work up and then talk to her about a small dose of anti anxiety meds just so I can sleep.
I'm sorry about this morning u know you love me this is just really hard
i wish I knew what to say/ do to make it better.  It makes my heart hurt to see you hurting so much
I know I just need to get some meds for right now. I can't manage the pressure. I'll be fine
I want you to be happy and if that means moving we can figure that out
Ok
I think some of this is first year stuff and I talk to Calvary monday
yeah, it's important to be mindful of how much power you want to give these ppl over your life.  At the end of the day it's just a job and you are good at it no matter what they say.
do the boys both have a pizza hut coupon?
Just josh
bummer
I got the boys and we're home now
Ok
Thanks
I couldn't sleep when r u coming home?
When do you want us home?
I'm a mess having trouble being alone
We can be home in 20 if you'd like? I thought you wanted to see a movie
I did but it's not till 650
K we'll be home shortly
Heading home now you want us to pick up food?
I made the boys grilled cheese
K you said you wanted chi ese
For us I mean
Yeah did you want me to order now
Sure that sounds good
I'll come home and drop the kids off then I can go and get the food
Ok
Right by the volleyball nets
Did you throw out our Christmas cards
Yes why
one of those cards was stacy's save the date and I was curious about the address
Oh I saved that one
oh good i need to figure out where this place is
my mom thinks its on the coast
How did that conversation go?
it seems like it went ok but we will see if she was just holding it in or not
she didn't blow up though so that's good
Well good.
The interview was amazing,!!!
You wanna go to IHOP for dinner tomorrow?
Brain balance
Your coming home now right?
Halfway there
Awesome!!! I got a second interview
Yeah awesome!
I'm at the Chick-fil-A stop light now
Can you call me
In 30 min
Ok
What if we took the 100 I have from ibotta from saving on groceries and the 50 we'd spend on dinner tonight and took the whole family to pirates voyage for Valentine's day?
We can do that can we still do something together though? Even if it is just going for a walk I'd like to spend some time with you
Or...we could go out to dinner and then I could just take the kids Saturday and you could have a minute to go out with friends study etc.
Whatever you'd like I would love to do something with the kids but time with you is also important to me.jist let me know how the mood strikes you
Ok we can meet here atPg at 530 and you from there
I think you are truly amazing with everything you do and the person you are I'm very thankful that we're married
Charles just shit all over my class. He didn't even know what grade he was watching. Ugh
Lol
While it sucks that he's such ancass if he turns in anything negative about your class he will look bad on him
True
Between y'all's history and then what ppl know about each of your teaching styles
Yeah just annoying how stupid he is...get me out of here
I'm sure there's a way to contest a review and it will be cleared no problem
Whatever...ain't no one got time for that. Let it go let it go...
The most fun way to make an adversary look bad is to let them do it to themselves
Exactly
What's the plan, I'm done for the day
It feels like you were laughing at me...
Of course not
Ok
Morgan was talking to me when you called, perhaps you heard that
Ok
How are you feeling
I want to run something by you when you get a chance
Ok 40 min
I think I got it figured out
Do you still need me
No someone got let go on my team and I wanted to talk through it but I think I figured it out
Howany days are we going to be away?
Leave tomorrow come back Monday
Ok
Really cause I'm buying now
Yeah do it I just need to talk to our neighbor about Molly
I'll make it happen, you need this

I'm so proud of you!!!
That was the partner of our team recognizing me across the whole company
Can we meet at the movie theater at 1
I don't think I can convince josh to do one more thing he doesn't want to do
0 that's fine, but I'm not even to the car yet so it will be later than 12:45
We are at fire p school no problem
At boat school we need your muscles for fire lol
You want a drink?
Can u put out the trash
Yes
Hmmmm not sure how that went
Why do you say that? I'm sure it went better than you think
Not really ...they are very unsure about me
I'm young definitely a little why don't you stay home with kids stuff
Are you capable of caring for the elderly etc.
Yeah... I've heard that before
Yeah
I think the best thing to do is change the conversation like as you think about the future of this congregation how will you meet the needs of the younger demographic that surrounds you
I'm sorry bean
I know how discouraging that is
It's ok...I think I got thru. They are a very hurting people I think I could help
That's really the bottom line, can your gifts meet their hurts
It's not really about you g or old black or white it's about broken and redeemed
Yes
I'm on my way
qRVehEYv004%
The Wi-Fi is broken so you will have to plug in

Oh ok
I made you shepherd's pie if you have to be married to a basket case you should at least eat well.
You aren't a basket case we are just in a trying time of our lives right now. I appreciate everything that you're doing for us and for the family
How are you doing, are you stressed?
I'm.fine
You are an amazing mother. I'm blown away by how on top of everything with the boys and their education you are.
Jude did great today!
I knew he would! He's a smart cookie
I love you and I hate that you don't like your job I want to do anything we can to find you something better
I'm meeting you @6 in Mt pleasant?
630
K thanks
What if I go to dubose and pitch I'm here 830 to 2 everyday. I'd have to take a pay cut but I'd feel less stressed I'd be there for the boys
If that would make you feel less stressed and more in control of your time I that sounds great
Forget it that won't work I need health insurance
Oh right
Once I get my CPA I'll have the time to grow this accounting business idea to a $20k job Shenique gave me some great pointers it just isn't an immediate fix
It's fine I'll be fine
I'm not convinced,I've been worried about you all day
The more I think and pray about it I think I'm just sick of working with kids
I think I could be happy doing basically anything with adults...kids is so much pressure and do exhausting
Did you read my sermon
Does that mean no or it's really bad
I haven't gotten a chance to read it yet, but I want to
Ok
it's possible that this is the best sermon that I have ever heard from you
it is intellectual, sensitive, hopeful, and powerful.  it is really everything that you are!  I like it
Thanks
I'm headed home now
I love you
I think you should not take the kids to hang with eli
They are very exhausted
Jude has a fever
Crap if you drop him off here I can put him to bed
He's fine here but I think I may call in for tomorrow.
Whatever you think,, 8 can stay home too
Are you on the water right now?
What
You sent me a pic of y'all on the boat
Yesterday afternoon
Oh, it just showed up,weird
Speaking of gun control, this exam makes me want to shoot myself in the face
I think I'm going to try that med today. Just wanted you to know
I'll be praying for you, let me know if you need to talk
How's our little man doing?
Pretty good no fever yet
Good, does he have more energy?
Yeah he's napping now
He looked like a truck hit him this morning
Yeah
How are you, stur crazy
Stir
No I was pretty exhausted too... interview late show....cleaning allergies. Feels good to relax
I'm sure you have been all out for a couple weeks now
Yeah
Hey does this mean they are going to make you work extra billable hours this week
That's annoying
its a bummer and unfortunate for studying purposes but it will be good extra money which is nice
Everything is falling apart
oh no why do you say that
bryan said I could do whatever
Ok...I'm sick Jude's sick I'm screwing everything up
oh no, did you get strep from jude?
No I'll be fine I'm just stressed getting meds setting up.child care dealing with Josh. I'm worried about this thyroid thing
I'm sure it will be nothing.  I understand why you would be worried but lots of ppl have thyroid problems and even the worst of them is manageable with meds.  I know its easier said than done but I think this is a "don't bark til you're bit" situation
i think you are a great mom, I know that you are doing a lot to provide for the kids and make sure they are cared for.  you truly are an amazing woman
I'm headed home now
We found it
I talked to the nurse she said take it and wean off as I take thyroid med
Does that feel right to you?
Yeah...
Good
I guess this is in sickness or in health ...sorry
I think you are making more of this than need be it will be ok
I am thinking I'll tell Daryl yes to everything except tomorrow. I just don't see how I can swing it with my parents having kids today and Thursday
Sound good?
I'll be home tomorrow. If you are going to give an exception then I'd make it this Monday when you have 3 nites I. A row
Ok...we can talk about it tonight
Sorry I was on a call I can talk now
I'm headed home now
Ok
How's jude
I think the medicine is starting to work ...I feel more stable less just tired today
That's good right
Yeah I think so
I love you, hope you're having a good day
Thanks rehearsal cancelled tonight
So I shouldn't come home early? Why don't you take the time to go workout?
I have to go get kids now my mom's in a panic about Jude...who takes care of me
i'm sorry should I come home
you're mom is just being silly jude is fine
No...do your thing
i don't want you to feel like you are all on your own
It's ok. I know he's fine I'm just tired
White tape, two apple cheese trays, regular teddy Graham's 2boxes
Thank you!
Do you mean white duct tape?
Yes and if you can find it a medium sized plain black t shirt for judr

Shelves are bare here
Ok
Dude needs to take his antibiotic this morning
Jude is going to fail spelling again
It's months of the year he's not getting it
I'm on my way home now
Love you
So all of a sudden they really want to work with me to get the kids here...wonder what thats about?
that is weird
perhaps they feel like you are more likely to stay if the kids are there
Probably
Just take it as a sign they want you
Yeah
Can you call me
Ok so your working late right
yes that is my plan, is that ok?
maybe we can plan a day that I'll come home early and we can spend some time together
Yeah it's fine
I love you, I'm sorry I've been working so much lately
It's ok
Love you too
Im really proud of you just a little lonely
I know me too but it will be worth it in a couple yrs
I know
Great news!! We'll make money on our taxes this yr
Awesome!!! How much?
I don't know yet
I'm.still shaky it's freaking me out
How much did we spend on furniture
Nm doesn't matter
Did you submit a house allowance number?
I don't think so
We will be home at 1 leave again at 145
I'm literally Alone in the theatre
Ok so I an rehearsing tonight I have tomorrow off. Meet me at fedora at 530 you and the boys can go out for pizza and then head home they don't need a shower and can just watch a show while you work. Thank you! I won't need you Tuesday or Wednesday
You're awesome. Thanks for all the work you put into scheduling our life
Thanks for noticing!
Also earliest Dr appointment they had was may 24
Omg
Can't you find another Dr?
Apparently they are all like that
That sucks
What did you eat?
A little chicken
I got you a salad
Ok
I really think Jude might be color blind
We played eye spy and he had us searching for "green" pollen on the car
Lol
Then Josh had us looking for the "white" sidewalk
They just fired the other sr associate on my team
What? Why
They didn't say in the email but I'm pretty sure it was because he had that African lackadaisical work ethic
Oh ok
I think it's entirely possible that this guy showed up to work high
Wow ok
I was correcting something he turned in and he basically just wrote the same thing over and over. Out of 34 lines there were only 7 unique lines. That and he had that one long pinky nail thing
That's not good
Will you please put the checkbook into my purse tonight so I don't forget to pay Terry Burnett
Checkbook is in the drawer
I'm headed home now
Maybe I shouldn't go this weekend
With everything going on
You should go because of everything going in. you need the break and we'll be fine e
I love you.

Pimped out for fun run
That's totally going to be awesome
They'll have so much fun!
Seriously where was this when we were Young I sold wrapping paper
And we liked it that way
At least you got wrapping paper to sell we had to sell our old toys for the school and whoever lost had to do their work in the closet

Nice
I'm sorry that this is going to be a really late one. I wanted to come home and spend some time before you leave. Maybe after you get home we can spend some time together
It's okay
I'm so sad about jude
i know but it's not new information, it some ways its good that we now have proof so that when the schools systems tell us we are over reacting we can show them something
it is sad though, i know it isn't the end of the world or anything but i am sad he will have the struggles that I had
Julie says no yo pg
she won't let him in?
Nope
I'm.gon a tour trident
interesting
that could be good.  just thinking through this.  if we are talking 40 min a day what if I did 20 min in the morning and you did 20 in the evening?  you said shorter spurts are better....
Or maybe I'll get Calvary and we will have enough money to send him to trident if I keep both jobs.
there are a lot of variables in the mix right now
Yes I'm putting in an application to trident and meeting with school psych at Drayton and I've called tutors we know If is an option now I'm trusting god
I also want us to pray and consider if Oakland might be a good summer option. It is five weeks for 8,000
8k would be easier than 30k but I agree it would be sad to not have him closer
after I got over the homesickness it was actually a lot of fun
Yes but if it's fun and he gets the help he needs
yeah true
I could try and live near by then tuition drops to 4,500
i've always said oakland changed my life
Not sure what's close
near by what?
oakland?
Trident does have financial aid and we hqualify for a grant
Yeah
Ok so we get a grant for 10,000 for trident from South Carolina. Could you please take on filling out the rest of the financial aid forms for trident academy. The process is on their website. It needs to be done by Tuesday
ok i'll do it this weekend
Thank you!
thank you for doing all the research and scheduling the visits and being such a great mom and wife
Do you have a sec so I can update you
yeah
I screwed everything up...and now Jude is so behind...I'm so sorry
None of this is your fault
It's all my fault
It could be the doctor fault or my bad genes but none of that is on you
I shouldve done more
What is on you is that Jude has gotten early diagnosis so we can mitigate the problem
There was no more anyone could have done
I'm so sad
I can tell, I'm sorry that all this is going on and I'm sad too that Jude will have these struggles but there isn't anything we could've done
Hope you're enjoying your conference
It's good I'm.exhausted I think I was running on adrenaline yesterday
Turns out I'm definitely not in my 20s anymore. After two days of up early to bed late I hit a wall, TGIF
I'm sorry
No worries. I'll be fine by Monday
Ok love you
Love you too, what time do you think you'll be home tomorrow
8
This is me missing you
You doing ok?
Yeah I'm fine
Good morning I hope you had a great kid free sleep!
Everyone good
Yeah boys just came to pick up bikes
I did the prescreen and it looks like we don't qualify but I can do the full application
They were like househd income of 65k and savings of less than 30
I think still apply do you have kids with you
No your parents said they were keeping them til 730
Ok
How much did we buy our house for
267,00
Our house is worth $280 910
Nice
Awesome
Just submitted the financial aid paperwork
Thank you
What's your ETA
930 is that ok?
I have fedora rehearsal at 530 can you meet me there?
Yes
Have you touched base with your parents about this bus situation
Yes
Why?
just checking that someone was going to be there.  is that going to be a regular thing?
Not sure josh hates the bus but I can't get there any earlier
On the list of priorities it's low right now
yeah, i get that the bus is not great
totally sometimes we all just need to deal with these little inconveniences
Yes
i think you are doing a great job juggling everything and caring for them
Not really but trying
don't sell yourself short you are a great mom, i know it is challenging right now
I can't sleep I'm exhausted and not up.to this 😢
Do we want Jude to tour trident they require it for admission
Yes but I think we might want to tap the brakes a bit until we have more info
They called and asked
I don't want to blow them off
Why don't you set something up for two weeks from now we will know more about Drayton hall and Calvary
Two weeks isn't blowing them off it's giving us some breathing room.
Ok
Jude can not have a private tutor of tutor brought into school
ok so step two is after school tutor or trident
Right
I love you I'm sorry things are so crazy right now
It's ok...im feeling better today
We will figure it out
good
R u ok?
Yeah I'm good
hey I was going to go out with Chris on Saturday if that's ok.  do you have a time that would work better for you?
I have a show Saturday can you do friday
i don't think I was going to do night time
I was thinking afternoon but I can ask if friday night would work
Oh no Saturday is fine then
i'll let you know what Chris decides but he already said he doesn't want to do late saturday
Ok
he said like 1 on Saturday so i'll be back by 5 or 6
Ok
So just found out Nick is going around saying I just drop vestry leaving him high and dry
Everyone thinks I'm an ass
Whatever, you know that's not true and anyone that knows you and knows him will know that is BS
I hate it here most days
Do you have thoughts on what you want for your birthday? I think I know what I'm getting you but I thought I'd give you a chance to weigh in
Jude to go to the right school for him...please don't get me anything
Did you do the tour?
Not yet my spring break week
Then why the decision, just because he seems happy?
I'm sorry Nick is a jerk face
I don't have a decision just the right school ...
Yeah everyone in my department is happily getting along without me avoiding me...it's fine
That's ok they are all jerks, I think I'd rather not have to deal with them if I were you
I just hate they are making me look bad
I don't think they can do that, they look so bad already the only ones who will listen are ppl who just want to gossip
Maybe..
Seems to me that everyone who matters knows your department is a bunch of ass clowns
Car still says tires low and the James island gas station one is broken
I can take it out and look for a pump when I get home but my air compressor broke
Ok I'll keep looking too
I pumped it up with a bike pump last night
Oh ...
They are all at 40 psi and their Max is 44 so your car 8s being silly
Or my tires are busted
In truth I think there has been something wrong with your tires for a couple years
A slow leak
What do you want to do about it?
I'm just about to the end of my rope with the van. It feels like it's always broken it's expensive it has very little pick up and it is hard to drive
So what do you want to do
For right now we should prolly blow up the tire and put it off
don't waste too much time looking for a gas station i can figure it out when i get home
Ok
taking the time for yourself is far more important than putting 4 psi in your tires
I had a panic attack today even on the meds
I'm not surprised, it sounds like you had a very stressful day
Kinda
I'm headed home now
You want me to pick anything up for you
No I made hamburgers vacuumed did dishes folded laundry and made lunches
Yes but did you find time to relax or do something for you
Do I need to figure out this tire thing for you?
There's a air thing St the exon near Sonic but I couldn't get it to work
The thing tonight starts at 7 I want to be fashionably late could you be home by 645?
totally i'll leave by 545
there is no one in my office today....
Ok
Also I have to stay after school Tuesday for a meeting...long story. Charles is trying to get me fired again. Can you work from home and get kids off the bus
yeah I'm sure I can.  I'm sorry that relationship is so broken
It's ok
i know that is likely stressful to be dealing with his stuff all the time
it seems like this stuff only makes him look worse though
It's fine Julie just thinks I need to make sure my voice is heard
makes sense
I have officially done all the Oakland paper work
was it a big packet?
Lots of peices
thank you for all the work you are putting into Jude's situation
Thank you
for what
how are you holding up?
I'm good
Dropping Chris off now
Just a reminder no rehearsal tonight so come home whenever. Tomorrow I need you to get kids off bus so please work from home. Let me know if that doesn't work.
Can you call me
How was your meeting
It went really well I think he'll be fine with the school stuff and summer at Oakland
Patrick schlabs just facebooked me
The bement guy?
The acna cathedral guy
You should accept
I did
I told Chris that he friended you and he said Patrick needs a friend to suggest looser jeans
Lol
Lol
I have 30 hrs after the wedding
I really want to go though... I either need to look for places to stay or be comfortable sending him away
right, i see your point
I'm really going to have to pray thru not being able to be in a room with Charles without wanting to kill him
probably, i understand why you would feel like that
i would be curious if he recognizes what a shitty thing they did to him putting him in a position that he was sorely equipped for
He sent an email today basically admitting he has no idea what we do because we never meet so could we please email him more often
it is sad really.  he could be good at his job if he was put in a position in which he was able to succeed with a competent mentor but he has neither.
He is also super arrogant doesn't accept help
yeah and perhaps he needs to be taken down a bit
ultimately that bad review is going to blow back on him
Agreed
i have two options for flights one gets in at 8:44 and the other gets in at 10:22 do you have thoughts?
I would say 844
sounds good.  you think I could sleep in the car?
Yes
so in order to make that flight i will need to leave my hotel at no later than 3:44
If you want to go with the other that's fine too
the earlier flight has a stop I didn't realize 
Ok whatever
ok i'm getting in at 10:22, i'm sorry but I just couldn't do  a 2am wake up time
That's fine
I'm out...is there a plan
hungry... food.... talk...
outside of sonic and Chipotle I could find two gift cards
Ok
one was to fish bone and the other was to a bunch of different places
You choose
olive garden, red lobster, and like 3-4 other places
i don't get out until 5 though
Ok
what is our time table?
if we need to be quicker we could try for something closer to home so we don't have to worry about driving
i think most of the places are up in N Charleston
Isn't there a Red Lobster near us
yes, I believe that will be our closest option
Let's do that
I want to go home and wash my face and take some Advil
ok I was sort of thinking you might like that because it is close
the pollen is really bad today
11.2/12
Bleck
was your day better?
I think I have a fever
Molly has no food
Thanks
Little burger lettuce pickles mayo mustard ketchup bacon
the jude thing should be taken care of
Oh how?
Fred said he encouraged them to read books on the bus.  He said he didn't want to put the kids together but he said he would let Ms. Anderson know about the guy talking to Jude
Ok
Thanks I feel so sick
hopefully that's the last we hear of all of it
I'm sorry about our date last night
you should take a sick day
i thought it was good
all I wanted was a chance to talk and connect
we did that
Can you call me
The lost my paperwork.... i'm so pissed
What?!!
luckily not all of it just my notorization
I'm sorry
That's a bummer
so the good news is that I can get it into the mail today and it won't cost that much the bad news is this puts me back again
i'm getting it delivery confirmation this time
Ok
It might be better we will be gone most of the summer maybe you can get a couple of tests down then
yeah that would be nice if I could knock them out over the summer
Yeah
Darrell cancelled rehearsal tonight
did you buy something on youtube?
I tried it didn't work
I'm sorry I can't do anything right
no problem the bank just called me
i'm leaving now, what size is josh
Small medium in the good night's brand
Coming to get you
Would you like me to make a salad for us??
We are at Cory's grill cheese should I bring you something back?
Whatever you think
Bring you one
Didn't the boys go to came last summer?
Yes but only a little like 400 max
Where, I forget. Didn't Josh go to karate camp?
Yes masters
We're headed home now
All the sudden my stomach doesn't feel well, do we have any Pepto?
!I don't think so
I feel very foggy today
I'm sorry
That sucks
i double dosed my allegra but i think it is clearing me up so that's good
That's good
if Kearney sent me to Hawaii would you come with me?
Yes
half price airfare and free hotel while i'm working and we could add a day or two onto the end... maybe next yr
How's your day going?
Hope you're having a good day
Yeah went to the movies
oh fun
what did you see?
Yeah you ok ?
Wrinkle in Time
yeah, i'm just not feeling great
I'm sorry
but I think it worked my sinuses are more clear
thank you for putting your black fadora schedule on the shared calendar
It's been changed twelve times it may not be totally correct I'll check later
I cleaned the playroom though we can move out the train table
Cool
Do you want to come home since your not feeling well or meet me downtow
i'll meet you here.  it will be fine
let me know when you get downtown and I'll leave then
I got a doctor's appointment for tomorrow
Trident would be really challenging for us but great for Jude
yes and yes i believe both of those statements
Although I do wonder if it might be overkill I think of he was showing multiple issues like dyslexia and ADHD or math issues and dyslexia I would be more likely to say he needs it
I think Oakland and Drayton may be enough
the drayton oakland thing seems like a good plan
Yeah
if he isn't showing progress after a year or two we can re-evaluate but there is no reason to buy a porsche when what you need is a Pontiac 
Agreed
Add suspenders to Easter outfit or no?
sure that would be cute
Done
how's your day going?
Kinda crazy
why for?
Can u call
do you need me to do anything tomorrow with you going to be at the doctor's all day?
Did you do lunches or should I?
Maybe the only good thing coming out of today will be then I ate Chipotle
While Chipotle is pretty great I think work or not we will learn something
Yeah...it would be awesome for your allergies though
Does the 0lace feel quackie
Place
No
What's the name of that cake I like
They sprayed lidocaine up my nose
Chantilly cake
Why
You want one for your birthday?
Yes I was going to get it for our Easter dessert
Whole foods
Right, but 8f we do it for Easter then you won't want it again for your birthday
Right I have rehearsal the night of my birthday I'm thinking donuts that day
Are you going to eat anything else or just donuts?
Just donuts
And coffee
Lol
Of course
Are you at home
Crap they are out of the in josh wanted
Out of what?
Bike was sold out
Bummer
What about the bike on display
Yeah I don't feel like spending 40 on crap they'll loose and throw out
The one on display was not the one on sale
My parents are going to take the boys tonight so you don't have to rush to black fedora
Ok, I'm likely going to head home and go to bed then when I get off.
Ok feeling crappy still?
No I'll be fine but I'm definitely not 100%yet
Ok
Wasn't he a cutie pie?
Yes
it doesn't seem like that long ago as I look at the pictures but he probably doesn't even remember that day
I know
What time do you think you'll get out
I was planning on leaving at 6 if that works for you
Sure
I'm sad
Why
Just feeling overwhelmed
Just focus on one thing at a time
Do you want me to do something?
My meds are wearing off...
Bummer
I will need your help Sunday so I can cook for Easter
Do you want me to do some of the cooking for Easter?
No just hang with boys

Hey Lindsay said she sent me a card with a Starbucks gift card in it did we ever get that
Hmmmmm
I don't know if I saw that but if I had I would have left it on the kitchen counter for you
I don't think it has come yet when did she send it?
She sent it like month ago
hmmmm
you could check the hutch
Ok
i'm sorry I'm sure I messed up and lost them
It's ok
Did we buy any furniture for your office
A printer or anything?
A chair and some desk stuff 100 max

I just got everything done and now I get to get the boys
I'm amazing
you are amazing!  I was thinking about you and your to do list
I did cry getting my blood work done but other than that
because of the needle or because you are nervous?
Just overwhelmed
i'm sorry
It's okay I just had a full plate before I got sick
i know
I'll be okay though how's your day
it's been ok i had some trainings that I had to do and i finished up a project that I was working on
we are in a bit of a slow time right now
Could you please take the trash out
Do you want me to drop this dessert plate off to you?
Yes please
I'm here
Leave at front desk
Thank you so much!!! I was in a meeting with the parents of child with cancer
no problem
how are you doing?
I'm good
sounds like you are doing important work today
Kinda it's different because they are Jewish but not part of a faith community
hmmmm that's peculiar
what did you do?
I love you
i love you too.  I'm so glad that you are part of my life you are so strong and smart and you are an amazing mother and wife I am truly blessed
Department meeting cancelled happy birthday to me
i'm not surprised.  The thing is that Charles hates them as much as you do.
it's sad really.  He has been put into a position he is totally unequipped to succeed at and has subsequently created his own hell.
He cancels if two people can't come
I feel like he should just do it no matter what
yeah or rescheudle
Yeah
Whatever works for me
whatever though, that means more time for you and you don't have to see them
and I didn't think that charles was going to get you anything for your birthday :)

Yes
Please tell Josh that he can sleep in the cuddle bed. He's having a shitty day
Please let him I'm.managing my mom and my life
Yeah I heard you I don't know what happened
Ok thanks
I love my present thank you so much!
I'm glad you like it
I got someone to cover my show Friday so we could have the whole night
Your parents changed their mind about Friday
I'm in trouble with Charles again probably because any time I do anything good he has to shoot me down after
What ever,!!!
It is important to give Charles his proper significance in your life
An interesting phenomenon is that every time you do a good job Charleston gets mad at you but you gain more clout so his opinion matters less
I can't calm down today I feel really awful
perhaps if you take a prayer walk
and eat something
are you feeling better?
A little bit
Still not myself
is there anything I can do for you?
No but thanks for asking
What's your plan for to tonight?
I feel super guilty I'm still not there for the kids
I suck
you don't suck stop guilting yourself
do you want me to try and get home?
No I'm almost there
I can't do today
Can you just hide in your office
I'm cleaning the closet feeling better already lol
I don't know what my problem is
you need more sex :D
😀
Probably
I just want you to know I'm here to support you
do you have a busy day today?
Kinda why?
you just seemed overwhelmed I was checking on you
I'm good....my thyroid is just out of control the last couple of days
i get to get off an hr early today
Why
i worked an extra hr on Tuesday
Awesome so what time is that
i think the plan for the car is I'll come back early tomorrow with the van and get the battery out of the car to take to an auto parts store
if I don't take lunch it could be as early as 3
I get out at 330 maybe we should do the car before bridge traffic tomorrow
i didn't bring all the tools i'll need to take the whole battery out
Oh ok
i can do it tonight after our date if you think that would be better
Whatever you think...I was kinda thinking I might take the boys to the zoo tomorrow since they were stuck at camp all week
i'll be done before you'd want to leave
Oh ok
i only need to van to pick up the battery because I'm not exactly sure which tool i'll need.  dropping off will be much easier, I can do it on my bike
Oh ok
Do you want to stay downtown for dinner then since you get out early
no, it seems like you want to avoid bridge ppl so we can go home
Ok
We should probably eat that cake tonight
if we have to I guess I can force it down

You know... before it goes bad
he said it was no big deal that i'm doing a great job performance wise
so I'm going to track hours and work accomplished in a spreadsheet in case there is another question and it will be fine
Ok sounds good
I love you
love you too
i'm still annoyed that he said I didn't work the right amount of hours cause I did but whatever.  He said he called a bunch of ppl out
I think Im just still scarred from.aurthur
Bummer
Bryan put the whole staff on a 8:30-5:30 schedule
Bleck
Bummer
it's not that big of a deal that's when I get in anyways usually I'm just nervous because if I hit traffic i could get in as late as 8:45 but I think I can tell him traffic and it will be fine
Ok what was his deal people have just been taking advantage?
well i know ppl have been taking advantage I just don't think that I was one of them and i'm bummed that it seems he does
I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure it's just an all for one thing
i just talked to NASBA, now they are saying that VTS send them an unofficial copy of my transcript
Omg
when i asked them 2 weeks ago if there was anything else that they needed they said no
at least i called and found out they wouldn't have told me for months
You should tell them it's probably official just doesn't look like it cause it's a seminary I check and see exactly what they are looking for.
they said if i get VTS to send a letter saying that the transcript is it on their letterhead then they will believe me but nothing short of that and it has to be a physical copy no email
Goodness
it was VTS's fault
the registrar says that they were doing some sort of a system conversion and sent out a partial transcript.  she said she's going to put it in the mail today
Ahhhh so frustrating
i'm on a conference call
what's up?
Molly ate one of those chocolate bunnies do I need to get her to the vet
no but she;s prolly going to throw up
Ok
when you leave i'd take the mat out of her cage and put her in the cage
i'll clean her up if need be when i get home
It was on the floor of the playroom this morning... unwrapped when I hot home
hmmm we should probably gather all the chocolate and put it on top of the pantry
josh tried to have cadburry eggs for breakfast
Ahhhj
its probably my fault, i should have gathered up all the chocolate and dealt with it then and I didn't
Don't forget to get Molly's food. She needs a 12lb Stella& chewys beef. There is a loyalty card on the counter
Thanks
Did you start the dishwasher?
Yes
Ii wasn't sure so I washed the dishes in the sink by hand
I'll empty the dishwasher when I get home
No big deal I'm going errand running with kids today it will happen eventually. We have brain balance today too
Can you eat the olive garden left overs for dinner
I love you
i love you too.  thank you again for doing molly's dinner
don't worry about me for dinner I'll figure it out
Ok
I'll be right by bed bath and beyond today should I add to errands?
i was going to send them something so we don't have to remember it
Ok
Can you make sure to write how much we spend on the board
i figure one less thing to think about would be great
yes
Yes
The kids are doing so great I'm.ssd you aren't going to see it
Willy Wonka I mean
i am too.  I know that you have worked hard on it
Yeah
maybe you can video a song or something
i'd love to watch it
I'll try sometimes brink tapes it
i went to look at this registry page and there were as many registered two women names as there were a woman and a man for babies and weddings
I've got important news for you
What
Someone in my office just told me it's free Ben and Jerry's day today
Good to know
Ahhhh no that's awesome to know changed my day
I'm super stressed
how come?
Everyone doing this sjoe is super last minute I'm a huge planner especially with kids
yeah i know you prefer to think ahead
They are stressing me out
Just remember you are an advisor it isn't you on stage
Kids are crying totally breaking down
You have a great reputation in the theater community so if they don't do well ppl will know it's not you
That's cuz they are teenagers
Fourth graders
Do you think Molly's food can stay in the car from like 4 to 7:30
Are you home now?
i think there is a red and black insulated freezer bag in the garage you could put it in
if you've already left i'm sure it will be fine just keep it out of direct sun light
they might thaw together a little bit but they won't go bad
Ok
Omg Calvary chose no one
Two African American candidate they chose no one ahhhh
i'm actually not completely surprised
They are like we all liked Jill omg
i think they have had very loose episcopal oversight between the fact that they are a black episcopal church and the diocese has bigger problems and then i think some church start to like not having a priest
Yeah I offered to interim or sub it would help with money
i bet you they have a pastoral model at their church
Yeah
if I were your bishop I would assign an interim and give the church an ultimatum find a permanent priest in 2 yrs or i'll close you
there is no healthy reason for them to have not chosen a priest at this point
I know
did you hear that st marys finally got shot down
, really
yeah, as I understand it not because of money but because of unhealth.  they were not growing and they didn't want a priest
i also found out that the casino in palmer was defeated
it looks like there are still some legal battles going on but I think they may have moved it to springfield
Well that's good
yeah i have no idea how they pulled it off but absolutely
sorry to hear about calvary i know you wanted that church
Yeah it's fine
I just feel sad for them
yeah
cause they are stupid in the face.....
Can I wear black shoes with dark brown pants
I just landed
Wow!
Yeah it's fast
Miss you already
I'm going to be so late for woek
Did anyone care that you were late?
I just bought the wedding present it was $32 i think
Ok cool
Internet is down suggestions?
Usually that is because it unplugged
Where ??? Every thing has lights says connected no internet
We paid the bill on 3/27 so I'd say maybe try restarting the box, there is a small button you push on the back of the modem and you hold it down for like 30 sec, and if that doesn't work I could do a three way call with attached and you
Although I guess you are the primary on that account so maybe I don't need to do that
Sorry about complaining this morning
Today just keeps getting g harder and harder
I'm sorry I didn't think you were complaining. I like to know what is going on with you
I got a parent complaint about my chapel yesterday. I'm exhausted. And I miss talking about the forgiveness and love of Christ!
why did they complain?
where you too christian again?
They didn't like the video I showed
why?
She said it was over their heads
i can't imagine that you showed anything too offensive
i think that that is a stupid complaint.  you have more education and experience in a child's development I think it isn't a big deal
https://youtu.be/hVq7DdfiYmg
Her son is in 1st grade but I also have fourth graders so...
i mean i would say that most parables are somewhat confusing this being especially so but I think the video does a good job
i'd also say parables are confusing only because of the depth that an adult tries to go
i don't think it would be too bad for a child
I did a brief explanation I think she just has too much time in her hands
i don't think anyone will take her serously
if you have anything going for you it is that everyone thinks you are an amazing teacher
Yeah it's fine I wish she'd called me and not my boss but whatever
yeah some ppl are just spiteful and mean
True
the sad part is that it upsets you maybe for a day but they have to live like that for their whole life
I know you'll be great I want to hear all about your play when your done
Thanks
sorry about the call.  I went through a metro tunnel
i am sorry that things are so crazy back home but I can't wait to see you soon
Having the worst panic attack
i hope you feel better
I do
good i was worried about you
supposedly my flight lands at 10:22

There's a house in my hotel
Lol
I miss you so much
I miss you too, can't wait to see you tomorrow
When r u done for the day?
I'll call after this meeting
Ok
I can't do it...another panic attack
Just take a breath and go one minute at a time. I'll be there tomorrow morning. I love you and I think you are doing a great job
I'll be fine this guy behind me keeps threatening his very young kids it's pissing me off

Can't wait to see you
Me too
My shuffle should be coming soon
Ok
What music you using
They screwed up my shuttle and put pm, fixing it now
Awww bummer do you have enough time?
I think so, it just eats all my slush time
I'm sure you know this but if you leave me alone with your family we will need er speak again
I've already checked in and I'm prechecked so it should be fine
Ok love you good luck
Lol no you'd need to stay there until I get there
I'm at the gate with an HR to spare
I'm on the plane see you soon!!
I got upgraded to first class
My first class is the nap you're going to let me have later
Jude and Josh want pictures since they'll never see it again
Flights been delayed
Oh till when?
Don't be so dramatic they'll see it as they are walking back to coach
Sounds like 30 min. Something about to much traffic
I'll text before we take off
I'll totally drive so you can rest
Have a good flight
Now they're saying we're going
I don't know...
Yep see you soon
Here we go
Oh
We landed
That's quick we need a few minutes
Take your time I'm good
I love you I'm glad you are coming to the wedding with me
Is there a Dunkin in the airport?
I'll check
We will be there in 20
No go on the Dunkin donuts
Bummer
We cant stop though
Looked it up on Google and it has "good for kids"listed under amenities
It will be ok I promise the kids will get to meet their family and we all should have fun
ETA 3 minutes
Great
Are you ok?
Yes
Just needed a minute
We're coming back
Stacey just showed up
I'm so tired today I can barely speak.
i'm sorry i know it's been a lot lately
you should take it easy today
i can fold the clothes when I get home just go grocery shopping and call it a day
How are you holding up?
I feel a bit better...we lost a kid this afternoon. Ran All around campus for 25 minutes
Where was he
In the bathroom in his classroom which the teacher was sitting in and just didn't notice
Lol you'd think she'd look there first
You think
Anyway I don't know if this helps but I don't think I'm going to spend more than like $50 on groceries this week
Porque
We have a bunch of food in the freezer I just need to pick up a few things for the boys I'll go shopping again for next week on Saturday
ok.  we are out of cereal, milk, eggs, and salad stuff
Ok
We have food clothes are put away bathrooms are clean kitchen is clean I would really like to go out with friends Saturday night is that okay
of course you can go out.  you could have gone out even if you hadn't done all that work.  Thanks for all that you do I know that is a lot
Thanks I need to run and get gas and return library books when you get home then I'm done
i'll get gas and I can return the books tomorrow while i'm out at my dr appt
Let's see how I feel. I want a new book
I'm headed home now
I love you, hope you have a good day!
I suck, I just realized I forgot to get gas
Don't worry about it. I know you have a lot going on at work no big deal
i was meaning to do it and somewhere between walking through the front door and sitting down for dinner I forgot sorry I meant to get you gas
It's really ok
What was the infection that you had?
Not sure what you mean?
Life's been so crazy that I'm losing details but you were talking about an infection that you had that you thought might be the cause of your hyperthyroidism. Or was that the allergies
I think I have a wisdom teeth infection my whole jaw hurt why?
That's what it was. I was just thinking about you. You should schedule that appt
I just got 80shots
Okay I've emailed the bishop and Laura about the check we should be all good for you to go on the trip
sorry for that
i appreciate your understanding
Filling out my black fedora schedule do you think you'll travel in may
i'm pretty sure that after the trip I told you about last night i'll be here for a couple of months
that is the best information that I have right now
Ok how would you feel about my taking on some shifts as a waitress at black fedora
why would you do that if you can act and make more?
i mean I don't want you to over do it but if you are going to be out of the house either way....
I'm only in two shows and they divide equally the opportunity the most I'll get is one show a week. I can waitress whenever. I'm going to call and check on supply too.
Ivrhink supply makes more sense than waitressing cause waitressing is only like 50 a night right
i just don't want you to burn yourself out working two jobs for peanuts your sanity is worth more
my back still itches like crazy
Bummer
do you have a crazy day or can you chill a little bit
I just finished everything! I have one hour to chill before class
awesome
i have my idea for our anniversary
What is it?
i'd like to go to Fill for dinner and dueling pianos and then either before or afterwards go down to ft Moultrie to walk the beach a bit.
Sounds good to me
i can keep thinking if you'd like but that was fun last time I think
Did you die?
I took some drugs and the chills went away
That's good you should still sleep
just got a call from the benefits coordinator for these allergy shots
she said they will be free after i hit my deductible which I think i've just about hit and then I will have to pay $15 for an eppy pen
Cool
i told her to go ahead and sign me up
How r u going to schedule that
the appts are about 30 mins every 10 days
i'll either do mornings at 8 or i'll do saturdays if i can
Ok...I can't wrap my head around anything right now will you please tell me this again later
yes, i'll tell you again when I schedule the actual appt
Ok sounds good
I have zero patience today. I'm a huge stress ball
i'm sorry.  i'm feeling overwhelmed today as well.  we are doing ok though it's important to remember that
I love you
Yeah I'll be fine
I'm so freaking scared for this appointment
you don't need to worry
It's not rational it just is...I'm shaking
the worst thing that he will say is you need surgery and you want him to say that
I don't want surgery
don't think about the doctor's visit think through the visit to you won't need radiation
this is minor surgery
Ok
i promise it will be ok
It's all scary I can't stop crying
no any time you get surgery it is scary but you will be ok I promise
let me know what day it is and i'll take time to be there for you
Ok
Ok
Today was hard
I'm still scared and I feel stupid
don't feel stupid surgery is scary but you are in good hands and i'll be there the whole time... as long as you need.
I don't want you to make fun of the things I say when I'm under anesthesia
Why did you tell the kids not to talk to anyone on the bus
Because when they talk to kids we get told that the kid goes home crying and their dad comes and threats us the next morning
Did that happen again
No but I would like it not to so I think reading books is a good alternative
We've had 2 or 3 conflicts haven't we
I feel like we have enough going on without them getting in trouble for some silly misunderstanding
I'm assuming the air b&b was the $1300 from 3/24
Oh wait no that wasn't it
That was a payment my bad
$1539 on 3/22 it was on my cc
And then an additional$300 same day
Oh ok. Is that it yep that's the security deposit
Yeah itthrew me off for a sec because it was on my cc
Ok cool
That's good right
Yes
Ok cool
I got my time off approved. Could you just take that Thursday
Yes whatever you need, I'm here for you
Ok thanks.
There's no reason to think I'd be pregnant right?
No
Ok...why r u mad at me for this date mix up
i'm not mad at you i'm mad at the whole thing and i feel awful for letting you down and not being there when you are having surgery
i want to be able to support you but i feel like it is never a good idea to say no to your boss
i feel sad and ashamed about not being there for you, but i do feel angry that i won't be around for this major event with all of the most important ppl in the company and pictures that will go all over
I just talked to the County Treasurer and she seemed confident that we could get a reissued check
Awesome! When w will you get back on Friday
I just talked to my boss and he said I could leave after the ribbon cutting but he didn't seem to care about the surgery
Lol
I'm going g to make the reservation now but I think my flight gets in around 730ish I think
When do you need me?
i got a flight that gets in at 7
God willing there will be no traffic at that time i can be home not long after that
Ok
These meatballs are delicious
!!!
they smelled amazing last night
OMG i forgot to tell you
What?
my allergist said that there was no scientific coorelation between mold allergies and cheese and dairy consumption
best.... doctor.... ever......!!!!
Headed home now
I really am sorry. I'm just tired
It's ok I just worry about you
I just got my period I'm sure I was just more uptight because of that
the only free weekend in May is really the 19th if we were going to do anything for the boys b-day
No we are going to Legoland in June
ok
Boys are having pizza and cake with a few friends on the night if their birthdays
cause i looked into it and it said PG graduation on the 26th because you meant May 26th not April.... I do that all the time no big deal so I fixed it
Thank
i'll call i na sec
Ok
I can talk now, what's up
I'm in a CPE about government protocol for grants and accountability and this room is like 80 degrees
I'm just leaving now so much for my alone time
what do you mean?  I thought the kids were with your parents 
don't your parents usually keep the kids till like 7:30 or 8
i folded all the laundry so you shouldn't have anything to do at home except veg
Ok thanks
you should have a solid 2 hrs or more before you have to see another person
I feel awful and I can't stop crying
do you need chocolate?
Yes
I'm going to bed worst headache ever!!!
i'm sorry.  i'll head home now and try to beat your parents.  we have drugs in our bathroom take two
No I'm fine you do what you need to do
its no problem i want you to try and get some rest
i was almost done anyways
I am going to make $525 at black fedora in May that happens to me the exact cost of staying at Legoland Beach Resort for two days in June should I book it
Also I want to play with the kids at the park for a little bit so will you call me when the cable guy comes and I'll make sure we are there but I just need a heads up
Sure
Everything ok?
Yeah I'm fine
Tell me I don't suck
why would you think you such, you are the best chaplain in your school's institutional memory?
I feel like if I'm doing well at work then I'm sucking at home and if I stuck at work that I'm doing fine at home and it can never be both places
i don't htink you are sucking at home
why do you think that?
you're an amazing wife and a great mom you just need ti give yourself a break
I hope so
you're doing great
i just got the check refunded
i mean reissued
they said the bank is in GA though so it could take up to two weeks to get to us
Awesome!!!
i don't know what happened but both of the ppl i spoke with in the treasurer's office were nice, polite, and helpful
it was like the twilight zone or something
Awesome
Have you heard from the Cable Guy
he called around 1 and asked if he could come i told him not until 4 or 4:30 but to call back before he came so you could get to the house
i haven't heard from him since
Ok
i'm guessing he called because his other clients are on the other side of the map so we will likely be last
Gotcha
Devin just called from ATT and said he was 15 mins away
Ok
i'm hopeful that it shouldn't take too long
I just added all the black fedora and St James Santee dates to our shared calendar as well as the Legoland trip. Which I might wait another week to book.
great thanks
I miss you and I'm feeling lonely
I've been so tired I'm sorry by the time you get home I'm just done
i know it sucks right now but it will all be worth it in a couple of years...  maybe we can be intentional to have a date night even if it is just staying in and catching up
it can be a no BF no studying no kids night
Yeah
i love you, i know that i haven't been home much but i'm glad that we are married
When do you think you'll be home
20 minutes
Love you. Everything ok?
Apparently your business is the one causing all the traffic. Today was the easiest commute ever.
Lol
Was Fred at there this morning
Yes
There's no way you can get kids at my mom's house right?
no i could take a break and go get them
I have to stay till 315 and I'm afraid that they will get off at the wrong stop
Pick up kids at bus stop near our house at 345. Also josh has game day today and can bring one of the games I left out.
You good?
yeha why
did you get to sleep last night?
Didn't pick up this morning?
I was up in the middle of the night
But mostly
oh i turned off my phone last night 
i didn't turn it on until we got to the bus stop
Oh ok
Our anniversary is soon I was thinking about how lucky I am to share this crazy life with you.
i'm glad we are married
you are truly an amazing wife, everything i ever wanted in a spouse
and friend
Thanks! I love you too and I'm so proud of how hard you are working! I know it's a lot I'm glad to see you happier though and being set up for success.
yeah i just don't want to let ya'll down
Not possible even if you never meet your CPA it's fine. We will figure it out!
i know we said we were going to transfer our anniversary but we should do something small on the day of
I'd love to just be with you but my parents have friends in town and babysitters are so expensive. What do you think?
no you're prolly right
We could do something fun as a family. Myrtle Beach? The zoo?
ok that sounds good
i have to go out on Sunday night
I have to be at black fedora on Thursday sat and sun
yeah
i know
are the kids not going to be at your parents?
What do you mean?
Sunday evening aren't the kids going to be at your parents?
Thursday we will meet you downtown Saturday you'll be home Sunday not sure
Oh ...hmmm what do you have Sunday night thought you were leaving Monday?
yeah the COO and all are going to be in town so it is grip and grin time
i can meet you downtown but remember i'm working out in N charleston now so it will take longer
we should talk about it tonight, it might be faster for me to just come home at this point
Oh right ok we will talk tonight
I'm so preoccupied today I can't get anything done
i understand
score, i thought that we were going to need to buy more meds for molly but we still have some so that's like $100 we doing have to spend
Yay
Bryan just put the calendar invite out for 6-8:30
On Sunday?
yes
will that work?
Am I supposed to come?
i don't think so
and even if so I can tell them you are working
Ok...I'll have to talk to my mom but yeah I'll make it work
if not you were working first I can say i can't make it
No it's ok...worse comes to I'll bring them with
I could use some words of encouragement. They are changing the carpool schedule and I'm super stressed about next year
yes but it seems like you will only have one more year tops of car pool because you will be picking up oquin
i am really proud of all the good work you have done at PG this year
chaplaincy is a long game which I know can feel overwhelming but you are doing a great job and have already made some really great connections.
I'm going to go to hr I'm going to go to hr, explain the situation and see if I can have my contract officially changed to 715 to 315.
did you talk to them?
I have a meeting on Fri.
ahh ok how do you feel about that?
I think I can make a strong case since they won't take Jude because of his dyslexia
I also need to talk to them about this email from Charles I just got so...
How's the new office.
uh oh what did he do now?
pretty nice
Did they like cinnabon
they loved the cinnabon
i mean probably not as much as jude and josh did but still they liked it
Lol
they crushed that roll
I might be overreacting he wants me to leave Bible study next week but we've never had anyone but him we'd Bible study before
I'm just not sure I should be the guinea pig for that
as predicted josh wanted more and jude couldn't eat it all
Especially at the last meeting of the year
And he didn't ask anyone else he only told me
Feel like he's setting me up to fail or at least have my colleagues pissed at me
yeah he hasn't exactly inspired trust
I cried on the dock for a half an hour my heart is pounding and I really want to quit
its a good thing you aren't coming to this dinner
just remember that he has very little influence over your daily life
What dinner why?
The dinner this Sunday I don't think there is anything on the menu you'd want to eat
Oh really what is it?
It's duck and lamb and quail
Lol yeah I'm pretty low class
Give me Chipotle or give me death
The dinners at the Macintosh you can check out their menu
So total score I got them to create a name tag for me that says teacher
Lol I don't know if I'd say low class
Cool
Wonder works here we come
Yeah it's low class just one of the 100 ways I don't fit in here either
No it's just different
I know God has a plan but today I just feel inadequate Everywhere I Go
Your taste in food is cultivated that's why I don't like coffee or beer. I just haven't developed a taste for it
You aren't inadequate you are just being hard on yourself
I love you
did you remember the kids have a doc appt tomorrow
What do you mean ?
someone from coastal pediatrics just called to get my new insurance info
do you want me to get the appt date?
No I was just surprised you knew cause I literally scheduled it like two hours ago. It's just well visit
i figured you knew about it but i just wanted to check because it wasn't on the calendar
Yeah ...I'm hoping we can maybe meet there since I have to get the black fedora right after
which office is it?
West Ashley coastal pediatric
ok and what is the date and time i'd need to be there
Tomorrow at 6
Otherwise we can meet downtown at 6:30 if that's easier
yeah i think i can figure that out
that would be harder i think
yeah i can make that work
Ok cool
the only steak option at this restaurant is a $75 32oz porterhouse
Wow!!
the idea was husk originally but then it got changed
the cinnabons are almost gone
Lol I'm glad
everyone is trying to act like they don't want to eat them but every time i go in there more have gone missing
Yum yum
I think they're going to let me work on the car pool schedule for next year so that should help
And I think I'll just do the Bible study because who cares what other people think of me
you mean you'll create it but also have to be on it still
Yes but I can make it work
hmmmm ok
The other option is go to hr I don't mind doing it if it's a schedule I can make work without spending $8,000 an hour after care
yeah, i'm just concerned if you are scheduling the car pool it will make it harder for you to get out of it when you make the oquinn transition
I think they are going yo fight the oquinn transition for lots and f reasons. Better to make my life livable now. Who knows what will happen
i hear that
just had my review
How'd it go?
it was fine.  they said it was were i was supposed to be
Why do you sound bummed
i'm not bummed i just wish i was more remarkable but they like what i'm doing so its fine
Who was review with
Ok well that's good
it was with Bryan
I think it's good! It's been less than a year. Was the tone good.
he said it was clear that this wasn't my first job and that i was ahead of the curve in the way that i am self motivated and i ask question and know what I don't know
yeah
Good!!
yeah i'm not complaining or anything 
Ok cool
Would you hate me if I didn't cook tonight
Actually forget it I'll cook I can cook tomorrow cuz of the boys doctor's
you don't need to cook i can figure out food
I cooked will you bring home some low-fat ice cream
yes
Moose tracks are chocolate chip cookie dough please
both?
No choose one
How long do I have to sit here alone before I start putting stuff away
I give them 15 minutes
i'm meeting you today at the pediatrician right?
We just finished at the doctor and are headed to Chick-fil-A will meet you there
Ok
I booked you a message for tomorrow at 1pm
Happy anniversary!
that was nice of you but you didn't need to do that
i just want to spend some time with you guys
You looked really stressed this morning. Don't you think it would be nice to just chill
Especially before you travel
If you really don't want it i won't click book but I thought it might be nice for you.
i love that you thought of me but i'd rather you went and i take the kids to the pool
i feel like you have a lot going on too and you never take time for yourself
i love you thank you so much for the thought
the email came out today that my boss officially made partner
or principal I guess
Wow! That's great!
yeah that's a big deal
i mean in truth the only thing that will change is that he has the title and the pay check to reflect what he is doing
you know what I'd really like for tomorrow is just to spend some time 
maybe we could go for a walk or something
Ok
i'm sorry
how's your day going?
i don't think i'm going to work late.
i just want to get home and spend time with the family.  maybe we could do a game night tonight
I'm pretty exhausted but I was thinking maybe I'd clean and get things set do we could do something fun tomorrow.
I really can't figure it out what to do. I hate that we can't just ho off for our anniversary. But, I'm also really scared about next week and being alone for everything. And I'm worried about you and looking exhausted and stressed
i'll be fine don't worry about me
maybe we need to take the weekend and make sure that we are ready for the week
i need to pick up my pants tomorrow and perhaps if we get some meals in the fridge it will feel more doable while i'm gone?
i need to take june 8th off for our vacation right?
Yes
but not the following monday
You do not need to take the following Monday
i didn't
i took that tues and then the friday
Great
Sorry I thought maybe it was the school my parents forgot to get the kids again
Turned out to be the people who I'm supplying for
Anyway Barbara seem to say that I would be able to change my hours
But now I'm feeling extremely guilty for even asking
I don't want to get in trouble with this job
i don't think you will

in truth it is discrimination for them to say Jude can't go because of a learning disability
and again, you are a really great chaplain
I'm banking on the fact they don't want to lose me
they need you, esp as they are in the middle of all of this controversy
Barbara was really nice about it
i think there is a line that needs to be walked where they need to be understanding of your family situation and i think that you are walking it well
I hope so
The picture was 6 yrs ago
Wow! Shopping is stressing me out
We are good, don't stress
Ok
Hey just leaving now
Sorry
Omg
I know they are actually going to another place
You can go if you want I'm home now
No I've already excuses myself
Sorry it was so late
You're an amazing mom, the boys went to school with no problems
Thanks this morning was rough
I think in the future we should notale any decisions until after you leave. I think sometimes the kids just have a hard time waking up but they are fine after they get going.
I think you did a great job today though
I don't know lately I just can't get anything right
That's not true, you're doing a great job. I think you're just tired.
Definitely exhausted
Everything seems harder when you're tired
How was the ribbon-cutting
hey i'm in a training what did you need?
I got in trouble for talking with Barbara
by who
Julie and brannen
so they got in trouble for discriminating against us and so they yelled at you for telling on them
Yeah
i don't think this is a big deal.  i think they would have a hard time holding that against you
Ok
they can't go to HR and tell them they want to fire the person that they just got in trouble for discriminating again
I'm going to just have to do whatever carpool schedule they give me though and figure it out
perhaps
I'm just over it
honestly, i think everyone is getting tired
There's a position opening at the Cathedral John's all is leaving
which cathedral?
your's
Yes
But I'm not sure because truly what I want it's just a small tiny Parish where I can be the only priest
honestly i'm not sure that they would choose you as a Dean.  Not because you couldn't do it because i totally think you could but because they are usually looking for someone with lots of education and large parish experience.
It's the associate position
it would be a great step career wise but you'd probably want to put in your three and be ready to move cause they are crazy there
i just found out that my site visit tomorrow is from 5-8 in the morning
That sucks can you see if there's an earlier flight
no the tickets can't be changed or refunded
it will be ok though
i'm thinking i'd love to do hangout video with the boys esp for Jude's birthday
Ok sorry
i just feel bad about missing so many important moments
It's ok don't feel bad
We are glad we have a dad who works so hard for us
i love you
I landed and I'm waiting for the metro now
Ok goodnight
Good night, love you my beautiful bean
Good morning! I just finished my equipment testing for the morning
I just finished getting life together. How u doing?

I made this your impressed.
Nice, are those sheep
Of course they are sheep how insulting!
Lol
Is that for chapel?
Yes
let me know when everyone get's home and then I want to video chat for singing happy birthday
Ok
i miss you gys
how's the birthday boy???
When's the birthday party
Right now
Can I vodeo in?
Want to watch us open presents?
Ok now I'm having a break down
The kids are in bed finally gonna cry myself to sleep good night
I'm sorry. I know today was a crazy day. I am on awe of you and all that you do for the kids and for me and for the family
Good morning are you up
one of my managers doesn't like cheese and now i'm not sure if i can trust her
I'm irrationally scared about this surgery tomorrow
I know but I love you and I'm praying for you
Ok
Please pray no complications
Plus as scared as you are it will be good to have them out
Yeah
I just wish you were here
I wish I was there too
I know
I'm lonely
I miss you
I'm sorry
I'll be fine
Is your team just icky
No they're fine
Are you doing stuff together at night
I'm eating Sonic because it feels like my last meal for a while
No
Lol
Well enjoy the break from the crazies and be prepared to take them when you get back because mama is going to be out
I'm on a trip but they are home and have their lives to do
Yeah
Oh that makes sense
That's my plan
I went to whole foods cuz last night I ate a calzone and I felt gross afterwards
Probably good to pace yourself
How's the department meeting go
It was fine Charles is an ass
Honestly I feel a little bad for him because Bryce and I totally double-teamed in and Nick and Hudson weren't there to back them up
So chapel will stay the same next year then
No but he agreed to send out a survey
Before we decide.
Fair, let the ppl decide.... How Democratic of y'all
I really need to pray about how much I dislike this man
He was giving me a hard time about not fighting harder for the O'Quinn position
Interesting
I really really don't like him
I told them I was having surgery tomorrow and nobody even question to ask me if they could pray for me nothing just okay
Did you say a little word of support from your department head would have helped
No
Did you say your have is messed up, let me help rearrange it
What?
Oh that should say your face
Stupid autocorrect
I dream of saying that
Good morning
i am so proud of you for facing your fear and getting these wisdom teeth out.  you are truly amazing!

Feel bad for me
Awww. Hope are you feeling?
It's not quite as bad as I thought
Are your parents there
Yes
Have you stopped bleeding?
No
the bleeding is the worse part and that should stop soon
For me it's swelling
yeah once the bleeding stops you can take some tylonol
Already did one side is way worse than the other
I'll be fine
I know you will but that won't stop me from being concerned
This really sucks! And I feel so alone
I'm sorry, I completely understand what you mean though
How's it going
Feeling a bit better now that I'm home
Oh, you were at your parents house
Yes
You should go to bed early
Could barely keep my head up but I didn't say anything stupid so yay!!!
I will try
I am proud of you, you Are being very strong
Thanks
I love you, can wait to come home tomorrow
When do you get in tomorrow
Love you too I look like a chipmunk
I think around 7ish
Ok
I've gotten on the wrong metro twice now
I'm having a bad metro day I guess
Ooops
Yeah, let's see if I can do it right this time
In things that suck about my life I think the coffee headaches is worse than the teeth
Good morning
Morning
How ya feeling
I'm ok. I'm still bleeding and swollen but the pains not too bad
Hmmmmm you should call the doctor, you shouldn't still be bleeding
I'll call if it hasn't stopped by 10 that's 24 hours
We need yo get my mom something awesome for mothers day
Ok any thoughts?
Not really
I find your mom hard to get gifts for cuz if it's too nice she'll take it back
Would she like a massage or a spa day?
Yeah. Apparently Charles is forcing me to buy and wear a hood for graduation. I really hate him.
Yeah I find hoods pertencious but he is prolly right it should be worn at a school
Yeah but he like looked up the coat on Amazon. Overstepping!!!
Think of it this way, you get one and we can both wear it... It's like it's half off
LoL
Can you find and order the right one on Amazon
I'll look but I'd doubt it
Almy
Ok
Yeah think Almy
I looked on Amazon and eBay
I can't find on almy
Also, we had a meeting he totally didn't bring this up then because he knew I didn't have one and ront want yo spend the money asshole
Does it matter what color?
yeah
the colors indicate your school
What color are we
i think we are marron white and blue
let me go call almy
when do you need it by?
may 20th?
26th
k
they don't open until 9
i'll call in a bit
you can't just get any one because they are shaped differently for the type of degree and then the color indicates the school
Okay
I know I'm overreacting he's just so selfish and inconsiderate and manipulative
i know you're not much of a pomp and circumstance girl but you only need it twice a year
It's fine just freaking ask us don't tell me in an email
i think the whole religion department will look different in a year or two
Yeah I hope so
i think everyone knows it's bad there and i can't imagine that deboise wil allow it to stay bad for too long
Yeah we will see
its bad for the school and it doesn't seem that charles has any political clout to protect himself
he's not bringing in money and the teachers and parents both dislike him
True. Plus I know there's curriculum changes that Audrey and I want/ agree on that Charles is refusing.
i know its hard but i think the best play is to wait him out and set yourself up as a good alternative head chaplain
Yeah
Can you please hold me when you get home
i would like that very much
I might eat a whole pint of low day ice cream
that's ok
just don't eat so much that you get a stomachache
Oh I know it's the first ok about this whole thing lol
are you getting any rest
Just woke up
oh did i wake you?
No
good
i'm glad you are getting some rest
how's the swelling?
Pretty bad
has the bleeding stopped?
Mostly
you might want to talk to someone about that
if you are still bleeding you could go anemic
I think it's ok just a little when I move too much
i guess you should stop moving then
:)
Probably
I was trying to wash all the sheets since I'm home. Honestly it hurts now
I gave up my Sunday show I don't think I should push it.
good idea
is it 4 o'clock yet
Almost
I might need a mother's day pedicure tomorrow
Yes you do
My face hurts
Is it cuz of all the beauty that god shoved into it
😘
Right
The swelling g will take a couple of days
Yeah
In the meantime enjoy the ice cream and Tylenol
Ok
Do you even want to come home to me. I'm swollen and crying and I can't talk
Yes I want to come home and take care of you
You're my bean and I love you
The airport is nuts
Sorry don't miss you flight
I'm on the plane now, finally
Have a safe flight
I just landed
Yay!
Do you need anything
Just you
Do I need to pick up the kids
No
Are you at your parents house
I forgot to tell you that your son was singing Newsies this morning
I love that about him

Want one?
No thank you
When you come home could you bring me some Greek lemon chicken
Are you ever coming home??
I found a hood for 40. With the right colors I'm just going to get it.
is it the right hood though
dr hoods look different that master's hoods
i know you don't want to spend the money but we can write it off i'd just be sure to get the right thing
it's on my to do list to call Almy today
I looked it up on it's website. It's right.
It's masters hood in black red and white our colors
ok if you think its right
It is
And it will come on time
ok well great then
Ok cool. How r u?
i'm ok
i'm having a bit of trouble getting into monday
but i'm getting there
did anyone say anything about your surgery?
Julie told me to take it easy. She also said Charles can't tell me what to wear but I'm just going to buy the freaking hood
i'm glad that Julie is being kind
Yeah, me too
i got my first allergy shot scheduled
Oh good
this wednesday
Do you want me to take care of the lawn air thing
no i am going to call them
Ok
i agree with you
these "lo mien noodles" are marginal
Yeah... bummer.
The food thing is becoming a real challenge.
i can imagine
I'm starting to get super depressed. Just feeling inadequate and awful
i noticed that
you are doing great though
you are just low on energy
you should try some bread
Yeah ok
i just got an email from NASBA
About what?
apparently it wasn't NASBA it was the state board that emailed
they said that they won't approve me because buried in their website it says that i need a 300+ level managerial accounting course and I only have a 200 level managerial course
but it didn't say that on any other site that i've looked at 
she couldn't even find where it said that on their own website because it was buried to deep
Bummer
we're going to end up having to pay for a new CPA review course
maybe i need to just forget this CPA stuff it is clearly not happening
Can you take the course online somewhere
I wonder if we're just going about it the wrong way maybe you should take a master's-level program get a masters in accounting and get your review course that way
no probably i can but even if i were to jump into a class this week that would be at least 6 weeks
That's okay it doesn't have to be this second
Long game we are in the long game
i'm on a clock with this review course
So we pay for another review course whatever
my long game is that i don't know how we will afford paying for thousands of dollars in courses and review courses and whatever
I know you're frustrated
it feels like i'm playing a game with Jude
they are just making up rules at this point
I know it's totally not fair
I think there's a couple options. One you can look at taking the CPA exam in another state the cost of flying you too said state would probably equal the cost of everything we're going to have to pay for.
2 you can look into going the super long route and getting a master's in accounting that also prepares you for the test
3 you can see how long the shortest online class for a 300 managerial courses and just see what you can do
You're good at this job this is just Hoops to jump through you're going to be great
Great news, your birthday card came from Lindsey. It is in the mailbox.
Yay
the altima needs new brakes in the back
Crap. I feel like we can't get a break lately.
Maybe we should nix the summer camp. Have you talked to your dad?
How much do we owe on the minivan
i haven't but I don't think we should nix the camp, it's important
my parents will come through
Ok
i'll take the car to Charlie and he will be cheaper
it's just the back brakes he did the front ones a year or two ago
I think maybe we need to re think life a little. Maybe we could trade in both cars and get two smaller cars for the same payment.
Or even less
I think we should think about it we don't love the van we need to replace the Nissan and I know you love the motor cycle but it's not practical and life is getting tight
we can look into it but the altima has no payment and the personal property tax is very low and the van has that damage we would need to fix first and we still have a payment
i agree things are tight but i think we are fine with where our vehicles are
the altima and the motorcycle have no payments on them and insurance isn't that high on either.
having a motorcycle has saved us several times when we have had a vehicle down or you have taken both sets of keys
brakes is normal maintenance for a car and Charlie is the cheapest in the area
Ok whatever I'm just worried about ling term feasibility. The van is already at almost 100000 miles. We really need to pay it off and get a new sedan I was trying to figure out how to do that. The car at 150 and needing constant repairs it's broken as much as it's fixed
In good news they fixed my carpool problem
I don't know I feel like we could turn both cars in and get two used sedans for the same payment and they would have a longer life span more reliability and more versatility. We could keep the motorcycle
Forget it. I just want you to figure out this CPA stuff it will be fine
i just got an email from the state board
Oh god
she said in order to sit i only need the one class but i'll need 12 more hours to obtain
well that class plus 9 more hours
Ok....so what do you want to do?
i think the route might be to see if the class is offered this summer and then I can see if she can explain the by laws to me because that is now how I read them
Ok
it would be nice if we didn't have to put the money for the classes down right away
True
Ok can I just be really real for a second.
what's wrong
I just need us to sit down and really look at our goals and priorities as a family and make a plan that supports those goals. A financial plan and a plan for handling all the balls we have in the air.
no that sounds right to me
i called up USAA and they said we owe $8k on the van which will be paid off in 2020 if we do nothing
if we put $500 a month down we could be done this year
So bluebook says we can turn it in for 7000
I guess that why I wonder if we should turn it in and get two smaller cars
What's our payment per month?
i think it's like 385
let me check
322.80
Ok I think maybe we should try to get thru one more year. Pay off the van by next year and then get a reliable sedan the year after
that makes sense
But we need to clean and make the Nissan as reliable as possible in the meantime. We need to be able to juggle the kids I'd we are going to make this crazy schedule work
Of*
If*
yeah i can do that
Thank you
Also does Charlie do body work ?
no
i asked when i screwed up the van
Ok
We need the light fixed. Also I really want the can fixed at some point
i can fix the headlight in the altima it's just a pain in the butt
Ok
and we can get the van fixed whenever you want
Ok
i talked to the state board and while I didn't get them to change it I got them to admit that they are holding me to a standard that isn't written anywhere
i'll call it half a win
Ok. So do you have a plan?
i'm looking for schools that offer the required class over the summer
Ok
the catch is that it has to be from a school they accept so i can't just get any online school
How do you know what schools that accept
i have to find a course that would work for me then ask them if it would work then apply
Okay
So are you going to work on that tonight
yeah i'm looking right now
Let me know what you find out
i was thinking if i could get a course at CofC then it could be a backdoor way into the master's program
That would be good
if i take a master's course from them and do well that has to carry weight and usually you don't have any admissions process for one class
i may have caught a break
finally
What is it
Clemson has the course that i need and it is starting today.  they have made it sounds like it shouldn't be hard for me to get in as a special student for that one class
it ends late June
does that seem not good?
Yes
Do it
Online?
yes
its a 300 level course which is what they said they needed
do you think I should ask them about it before actually signing up?
Is it 300 level managerial accounting
yes clemson does this weird thing where they use four digits so its ACCT 3030
which i'm guessing translates to 303 in other schools
I'd ask then
registering is only $25 so I think i'll get that far tonight
Ok
they guy at clemson that I spoke with said that my personal copy of my transcripts would work, they don't need to be official copies  they just want to be sure that I have the pre-requisites 
Ok
Hey what would u think about taking the Altima to Charlie tomorrow around 7 after traffic
Ok
Score there's a little gym in Charlottesville I can pay by the say $35 and sign up whenever for josh. That's awesome!
great!
i emailed to ask if the credits would count
they said it "should" 
" as long as it’s not part of some sort of certificate program and you’re going to earn semester hours that would be applicable to a degree."
i don't know why they can't look up the damn class and give me a straight answer
I'm sorry but I'd just go with it it seems like an answer from God for you
i love you
I love you too
Ok if I get my nails done today?
totally go do it
i'm changing my state to VA
What does that mean
i will still need to take this managerial course but i won't need to take the other 12 hrs
and it makes no difference which state my CPA is through until i'm a principle
Ok whatever
So do you have to go to Virginia to take all the tests
No
Oh ok
It won't make any difference for me cuz Kearney is a VA based company
Can you just do that when you live here
PS I'm so exhausted nothing makes sense to me right now so it's possible that this all makes a ton of sense and I just don't get it
Yes, there's no residency requirement it is just about who gets my money
Ok that makes sense
SC wants me to have 36 acct hrs while VA only requires 24
Ok that makes sense
Sounds good
Apparently my brother is sending Eli to private school next year
Which is making me really sad
I can understand why but I wonder with what money
Does Jen really make enough to support the family, a new house mortgage, and private school
Yeah I know Jen is applying for new jobs maybe they make more. Plus they only have one kid and my parents are giving them a deal on rent
So their plan is to not move out then
I don't think so. That's why they are looking at schools on John's island
Do your parents know that they are going to squat in their house?
I don't know
It is kinda weird leaving before 6
That's cool though
Yeah, someday after all this school CPA stuff this could be my life
That would be nice

If you get home before kids do maybe we could
I tried to reset the internet but they will need to do it from their end and they don't open until 8
Ok
Thanks for trying
I'm trying to write my sermon and remembering that I'm not that great a preacher. There's probably a reason I'm not in a parish
i don't think that's true
you are a fine preacher, you just are not an intellectual preacher which some would say is actually good
intellectual episcopal sermons are boring and unrelatable
i would always get like that when i got stumped with a sermon but you just have to remember that you are a good preacher and the sermon will come
Are you coming home early tonight?
I would like to go workout
yes i'm hoping to be home around 6
you can totally go workout and we can drop the car off when you get back
Thanks!
i just bought the garbage disposal
Awesome!
So my mouth is killing me I don't think I can work out yer
You sure?
Do you think something is going wrong?
Going to dentist now
Will you need me home to take the kids?
No
I just got into this class and they've already had 3 quizzes that I need to make up by tomorrow
I might try to stay late and get on that
Oh god. Stay and work we are good here
I love you you can do it
Thanks
Can you call me
what's wrong
Nothing dentist said go back to soft foods till Monday
oh that sucks
i'm sorry
Yeah I'm ok just frustrating and I'm tired
is that still no grits no rice
Yes
i think if i were you and i was trying to avoid a lot of sugar or dairy i'd do oatmeal and honey
and protein shakes
we do have that cheesecake stuff in the fridge
No oatmeal
yes there is i just had some this morning
I can't have oatmeal
oh, sorry i thought you could
pudding?
I was mistaken
i think you can get sugar free pudding
you can probably also have broiled eggs or whatever you call it when you boil it without the shell on
poched
Ok
i'm sure it won't be your favorite thing in the world because the yoke will be runny but if you put it on toast the yoke will soak into the bread and make it all soft
Ok
damn, i got so caught up in this class that I completely forgot that we were going to drop the car off today
i'm sorry i messed up.
It's ok. What's plan b
well i think it's too late for us to go over there now even if i was to leave right now so plan b has to be tomorrow
Ok
going now would put the kids in bed at least at 9
Yeah not good
You coming home?
So the officit verdict is I will have to be after school on Wednesday and Thursday next year. I'm probably freaking out over nothing but the whole point of being a teacher is to be after school with my kids
Now 2 days a week almost half the week I can't
Is that both semesters?
Yeah
unfortunately, i'm in a meeting right now
it should be ending soon though
Ok
sorry
it sucks that you will have to be gone two days a week but it still has you with the kids after school more than most jobs
It's fine
I could offer to do a weekly morning Eucharist and let them split the afternoon time. But, I'd have to do it every week. What do you think. It's going to be 45 a week to get after care that lasts till five when I can get home.
Today sucked. I'm exhausted.
Sorry
I've literally been in meetings all day
I'm sorry. I know I'm just exhausted and annoyed with Charles
I get it
I was wrong each chapter has 2 quizzes
Bummer
I know he is frustrating but you almost never see him
And yet...he makes me miserable at every turn
There's been a lot of construction the address is 415 trapier dr
I can stall what's your ETA
You can come on I'm here reading
Ok
Was it broken?
No!!!
Yay!!
Does that make you feel better?
Yes it does
You know what is broken?
The internet
Again
Oh god
Yup, so that happened, the rain came and the internet went
Just talked to att and they said that there is a problem with the outside line and would need to send someone Tuesday. We don't need to be here but we are down til then. I. Going to my office to study
Ok
So I changed my my mind I won't be applying here. This place is crazy!!!
Lol
I will not have to do Thursday Eucharist

I made 64 of these to line the walkways up to chapel
that's awesome 
i can't believe that i didn't go to church on pentecost
i totally suck
Ooops the car thing...when do we get it back
wednesday would probably be the easiest for us
does that work
Yes
maybe we can go get dinner too and make a date out of it
Sure
Is there a different Anglican lectionary?
i just booked my next flight i leave around 2:30 on Sunday the 3rd
why
Ok
yes there is
I'm helping Charles With You Chris tomorrow and I can't figure out where he got his Gospel reading from
http://anglicanchurch.net/?/main/texts_for_common_prayer
i went to go heat up my lunch and it had mold on the top.....
bummer
Sorry
not your fault i thought i had another day in it
i'm just gonna eat pretzels from the breakroom
Ok I'll cook tonight
no that wasn't a hint i can figure it out 
did that help/
What?
the link
i mean did you find your gospel in there
No
oh bummer
I'm not sure where he's choosing from
there is always the whole he made it up line of thinking
bryan lifted the hours thing
he said back to flex hours and teleworking as needed with permission
Yay!!! That means maybe we can leave a little early for vacation
yeah
almost no one is going to be here that day so I'm going to ask to telework
Also after school is out you could go in earlier because I'll have the kids maybe study early instead of late
that could be nice
i could study from 5-9 and come home at a normal hour
Right
i'm reading this document that reminds me why grammar is important
I am Mom of the freaking year
I mean not that they appreciate it but I still am
why's that
i mean i know its true but what specifically?
Pizzas picked up for the party cake is picked up for the party and Camp forms are picked up from the doctor and ready to be mailed
nice
That's some serious freaking juggling
it is amazing how you keep all these things straight
And I'm still going to make it to the bus on time
hey i can go out to get your meds tonight, i need to go out anyways
I know right
Thank you
Charlie locked the keys in the car
Oh no
He said he can get into it. I'm sure he has a slim jim
Ok maybe we should go tonight ineed
A second tomorrow
I can't. The office is doing a thing for Bryan and then I need to knock out these quizzes
Oh ok
I love you
I'm actually really looking forward to going out tomorrow even if it's just dinner and to pick up the car
I feel like it will be good to catch up
I'm going to get the car with my dad tonight
Oh ok
I need a minute I'm depressed as hell and barely hanging in
I don't have a meeting after school tomorrow. I don't want to wait around until 5:30. So I'm going to go get the car with my dad tonight. And then maybe we can just do like take out together tomorrow.
Can I pay with a check
Do I need to tell Charlie I'm coming
How much is it
You can pay with a check. To Charlie ashworth
I think it's for 480
Wait til you get there
Okay
He says he hasn't gotten it open yet
Will get tonight?
My dad is coming at 645
He said he'll let us know
Should I cancel?
Can you tell him we need to before 640
He'll let us know around 640 or before if he gets it
do you want me to come home?
No
would it help to talk? and catch up?
Would it be okay with you if I ask my dad to drive me to pick up the car tonight
I just need some time alone to chill and reflect I've been going non stop
you can do what works best for you.  I'm not sure when Charlie is going to have the car unlocked though.  I told him earlier that we were coming tomorrow so i imagine it just slipped ddown his priority list for today
Ugh.
i'm sorry
I texted you at like 1
if you want i can come home and take the kids and you can just go 
No it's ok I just don't want to sit in traffic the only free time I have this week.
if you texted me at one i didn't get it
102 pm
we had a conversation where you suggested it and i told you i couldn't go around 11 and then i didn't hear from you again until 4:50
i'm sorry that you are not feeling well but i can certainly come home so you can go out if you need
or i can take the kids to the pool while you stay home
No it's fine
Just tell me what Charlie says
i'll let you know when he texts
My dad says he could call triple a
Charlie just got it
Yay!!
you guys can go now
Just finished both quizzes. I'm coming home now
That's great congratulations
I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm having the worst panic attacks
I think your tired and stressed
Perhaps you should schedule something with palano to get an update
It's basically like Everytime im supposed to be two places at once
Well I think that would point to stress
It may just mean that you have to be better about saying no to things and/ or making sure you have time to get from one appt to another
how's your day going?
are you done for the day?
Yes
I have to go to the library and the post office but other than that yes
good
did the att guy ever come back?
No
interesting
What's your plan?.
i was going to come home when i'm done and i'll study after the kids go to bed
Ok
Are we doing takeout
that sounds like what would work best for you
Ok
let me know where you'd like me to stop
Or I guess we could go someplace close like Red Lobster
we've always said that we wanted to try that place on 17 but i'm fine with getting take out too
Yeah I think we have a gift certificate from Red Lobster which is what I was thinking
yeah but you don't like red lobster
which is why we've eaten there once in the last 11 years
Yeah but I feel like shrimp
i want you to go somewhere you want to eat
ok
i'm in this teleconference that was supposed to start at 4 but no one told me they changed the number to call in!!!  annoying
Sorry
NBD just annoying
I'm headed home
time for another good news bad news day
What
bad news, I got a flat in my motorcycle
Good News, I just got my compensation information in
i got a 9% raise
!!!
Congratulations
yeah that will help us out a lot i think
What's the bad news
i told you the bad news is that I got a flat in my motorcycle which is a bit more of a pain than a flat in a car
i'm trying to get chris to give me a lift and then it will only be like $50 to fix
Ok I can pick you up if I have to
well i need his trailer and then he can just give me a ride
you might need to drop me off when i go to pick it up though
Ok
How much money is 9%
i'll make 54,500
That's great!
yeah it will help a lot i think
i doubt that i'll always get that type of raise but i'll take what I can get
And it shows they like you!
Absolutely!!
yeah, i feel like i'm not up to par lately
I just went to my doctor's appointment on the wrong day
oops
i went to a diocesan party on the wrong day
Sucks! Especially cuz I was super stressed about it
poor beano
I can't leave work two days in a row I have to reschedule and they're saying September 6th
what???
no, i'd leave work if you need to take a sick day
its the end of the year
They found me an appt today
oh great
Yeah
I'm stressed though
why
it could be helpful information if they say that its come back right
we could potentially isolate the cause
Internet is fixed except now I still can't get the TV to work
You need the Netflix password?
No. The Ethernet cable is unpluggy not sure how to fix it
I love you
i love you too
I'm only on 6 times in June
It's like 400 bucks at Fedora this month
400 is good
how do you feel about 6 times?
i found computers in the 200-300 dollar range
i'll need to do more research as to what we actually need
Okay
I'm stressed about money. I'm stressed about going to Charlottesville. I just hope I can do all this.
i asked my local computer expert.  any computer will work for watching TV and surfing the web
Awesome
do you want a CD drive?
Maybe for videos
we probably need to be able to do DVDS
yeah
My show is not till 8 so if you're home at 630 that's great
ok good that gives me 3 hours to get at least one of these tests out of the way
Oh good
is your day going better
I'm ok. I think I'm a little sick. just a bad headache and exhausted
i'm sorry.  doesn't sounds like a very good day to go out
I'll be fine. I just need school to be over
yeah it will be nice to get a break i'm sure
Yes. I'm.sorry this class is stressing you out
it will be fine i just want to do well in it
it's hard when you only have 5 questions on an exam
one mistake takes you to a high C
Oh god that does suck
yeah i mean i'm a little rusty but i think 93 is A 85 B 78C and 71 D
Bleck
so 5 questions is 20 points a question
Yeah are they essay can you get partial credit
no they are multiple guess
i think the whole class will be multiple guess
Bummer
hopefully i'll make up the difference in the exams
Ok
my boss sent me a IM with slang and I had to look it up to understand what he was saying
this is what old feels like
Yes yes it does lol
the theory portion is 60% of the exam
i think that will help
Oh good
I'm headed home
How did the test go?
I got an 80 on this one
Which is a 77 for the exam overall
Awilliams@saint-james.org
Andrew.d.wms@gmail.com
Awesome!!!
Headed home now
Ok
I know you don't really care but I'm exhausted and doing the best I can
I do care that you're exhausted and I think you're doing a great job
I got a coffee that is saving everybody's life
So I was reading this text book and I was thinking that the reason I had to re-read sentences all the time was because of my issues but the dude alternates between running on sentences and incomplete sentences with a little creative punctuation sprinkled in for fun
Oh god
He used a colon for a period
Annoying
I really appreciate you putting the eggs in my breakfast this morning.
It was so nice to have one less thing to worry about.
Have a great day I love you
Love you too
Andrea says no to mccleanville so...I guess that's that
didy ou ask why?
They want them to have a year with an interim
oh
is that assigned or are they searching for an interim now?
looks like the camp would be an hour away as well
Assigned interim
which raises the question what is the diocese waiting for
Yeah. I'm just bummed about being here with Charles and Nick another year
yeah i hear that
my teacher just responded that she won't let me take the exam early so i have to figure it out
I think the bishop really wants me to do one of these 23 churches.
I'm sorry.
how do you feel about that?
You should give her a shitty review.
I think I just need time and space to process all of this
i mean she answers the questions that i ask but she isn't exactly forth coming with information or teaching mojo
Yeah
perhaps when i get back you should take an overnight retreat
i wonder if you could stay at the clergy cottage at camp st chris now that it's your camp?
It's not until June something but maybe
if you tried to go to the camp you'd have to book that now because it is slammed once schools out
the staff isn't exactly helpful
That's ok
on the other hand, you might just take some of your down time and have a mini retreat
they told me to rent a car for this site visit
Why is that?
they needed one more car and apparently me and another guy are both leaving at the same time 
i guess he didn't want to rent the car
cuz he's the guy that's basically leading the whole audit
Well that's fine right?
yeah no that's awesome
its just a bummer that i get the car on the trip that i'm going to be studying the whole time
but hopefully i'll knock the exam out early
i just re-read the email and she said she wasn't going to unlock the exam until the day i come back
That's good right?
I have cramps so bad I can't stand up. I literally have tears in my eyes.
yeah i'll make it work
you think that's the thyroid thing making it worse?
I don't know but it makes .e scared
I have to be healthy
we will get this thing figured out
the good side to not being allowed to take this exam until wednesday is it takes a lot of pressure off
That's good
i need cookies at work....
I'm a mess
i'm sorry
It's ok
Have you talked to your family about camp
yes it sounds like they will do 3k
Ok
We're they mad
no
i think they are happy that he's going to oakland
they said they might try to get there for the end but they are going on a cruise so you know
Right ok
i told them the deal. i was like the whole thing is 5k because i'm an alum of that 3.5k is the tuition and the rest is the lodging feel free to give as much or as little as you want
and my dad was like i think we agreed to 3 before
Ok
did you have an ok day?
some day we are going to be past this stage.  on my good days I can almost see it.
Right. I just need the kids to be able to stay alone for a half hour game changer!
totally
i image at this time just to leave you alone while you are in the shower would be nice
That would be nice
i'm so stressed
i'm gonna have to retake this class i'm just not getting the information
i got a 40 and a 100 ... i guess that still averages out to my normal 60 quiz grade
I'm sorry
It's ok I'm feeling g better after getting the 100 on the second quiz
It averages to a 70 if that helps
Yeah which will keep me about the same
Ok. I am in a seriously low place so I'm.going yo go now ok?
Go where
To bed
Shocking I'm in trouble with Charles again
what for now
not that it matters
He found out about the lesson with the Quran and the Old Testament and he's demanding that I approve all my curriculum choices with him
tell him to take it up with julie
or if you want to be snarky you can say you would love for all curriculum to be approved by everyone so that you can talk some about the theology of spiderman
Yeah
we have a meeting in a couple of weeks and they totally took my questions to make the agenda
Awesome
there is something fairly unhealthy that I need to figure out about my relationship with work.  If i'm not being constantly affirmed I'm scared that they are going to cut me loose
how did the graduation go?
Yeah I'm like that too it's probably a millennial generation
I think it's also left over from Arthur in that crap
Graduation was cute
Nothing spectacular though
well anything with josh in it will be cute
i think it is mostly left over Arthur
True
i'll feel better about it once i have my CPA and i will feel more marketable
I know that's how I felt about being a teacher like if I had my certification I feel more marketable
Maybe I should take a masters and something for PG to pay for it so I have a second career option
i'd take classes if i were you just because PG will pay for it and it can't hurt
i'd go get a doctorate
I just want to go home
its gonna be 100 degrees everyday that i'm in TX
Look does your hotel have a pool
They are probably cashing our Oakland check soon if not today
it will be ok
we have enough in our checking to handle it
Ok
Will you be home by 6 or 6:30 at the latest
yes i'm leaving at 5
I have a show tonight
or as soon as my call is over
Thank you
i have a call that starts at 4 but i don't see it going longer than an hr
Ok thanks
Do you know anything about Josh's book bag
No
ok thanks
He doesn't need it though
Don't stress
i didn't i just sent him to school without it
i figure if his teacher is pushing to not have any kids she is probably not going to make him do very much work anyways
Cool
Could I schedule a massage for 6 on tomorrow or do you need to work late
i can make that happen
The students are gone!!!
See there is a God
Exactly
is school better without the students?
It's miserably humid out
Yes
I didn't get the faculty rep position
Probably just as well. I'm just really wondering what God has in store for me you know
I got left out of another important group of meetings today
So with all that in mind I'm thinking of going back and getting a master's in like a business or HR
Just so like you I have something useful under my belt
I think I could be good at HR. And it kind of coincides with my call to Racial equality and justice
Plus it's a degree I can get in 2 years
that might not be a bad idea if you are already with not serving as a priest
I love you
You too
Are you guys having fun?
Yes
You ok?
Yeah, I'm just worn out. I'm gonna take these last 2 quizzes and co.e home. Hopefully in an hr
Ok. I love you.
I'm coming home now
How did the quiz go?


Are there any photographs?
What kind of cake do you want for tonight
Why don't you just get the cake you got for Lisa, that was good
And some vanilla ice cream
Ok
Pant size?
I guess it depends. Jeans I'm a 34x34 slacks I'm a 36 long. But seriously you don't need to get me anything I'm good
I love you
Where are you
I went to pay for thebike
Did I mention that I love you?
I love you too and often need the reminder
The dude from my office that I'm traveling with was like it seems like it might take some time for you to pick up a car I'm just gonna get a taxi
What?;
I hate people I'm sorry
Yeah he's smart but has the emotional iq of a toddler
Obviously

It won't play
Isn't that nuts? That's my plane
Yes
I sent it to your association rector email too
There's a smoke machine or something against a blue mood light
That is crazy
https://fivedates.co/ I think this looks fun!
Yeah that looks like it could be cool
Just got to my room
I love you
Love you too how's it going
As expected for the most part
Mting after mting in a basement
I'm sorry
No it's ok. It's good info and frankly the basements are cooler
Ok cool
You ok?
Yeah I was just gonna check in before we went out I'm in the car now I can call in a few
Ok

The bull is totally alive
This is exhausting. I'm afraid of Charlottesville.
I'd give yourself some grace
Ok
You'd still be a supermom even if you didn't entertain the kids every hour of the day
I'm sorry I was a mess this morning. Just a good bit of crazy here
I understand it sounds a little crazy
My dad says he's going to give us 1500 for Charlottesville
Can you talk?
LG 49 in. Smart TV. And you can surf internet with it.
329
Done
Holy crap I just got all my texts for the day I didn't get them while I was in the basement
Weird
My manager just stopped by and said the senior manager is going to take my spot tonight for the rest of testing
Why
Birthday
Nice
Netflix password when u get a chance
It's really simple
48UvGW6hY4Z7gzs!
Thanks
So yeah this TV is awesome #worthit
Miss you glad you're coming home today
Looks like 250 ish is the cheapest flight
What airline
I just did cheap flights
Can you change the time of your 2-hour doctor appointment
I can take it to an HR if need be why?
I have to go to the doctor that day though
It just seems like a strange day to book a doctor's appointment for
When are the test due
It's the allergy shots
Saturday
Gotta go we can talk later
Ok
The more I think about it the more I think you should just figure out this class. It's gonna be stressful if your worried about class etc. While we are in Legoland
When Love a call when you get a chance
I'm coming home! I'll call you when I get to Atlanta around 7ish
Maybe 730ish
I have a baptism prep meeting at 7 I should be done by 745
K
I see two options though. Either you skip this trip and maybe take a boys weekend another weekend in June or you come and fo your studying etc on Sat at the hotel. It would be hard to.do Friday because we are switching hotels. You decide. I'm cool either way but I would like to know for planning
Thanks for the heads up
Just got off plane, we got held up in San Antonio
I'm glad you're coming with us
O just missed my flight
How?
It departs at 930 and I got there at 920
OMG they didn't let you on
No I still see it
It hasn't even pulled away yet
What r u going to do?
They booked me on the next flight at 1140
I bet it was a full flight. That sucks!
I guess I have time to eat now
So you're not going to get home till 130?
Something like that. I'll get another day of per diem though
Now I'm wondering if you should do Legoland. I don't want you to get sick. You'll be exhausted
Please stop trying to kick me off the family vacation. I want to go
Ok. I just don't want it to end up with us fighting the whole time because your exhausted.
I need this trip to be fun and successful. Sometimes when you come home from these work trips it takes a second for us to readjust
Well we would readjust if we just avoid being together
I put clean sheets on Josh's bed. Sleep in as much as you can. I love you.
Sorry for the crazy morning thank you for breakfast that was sweet
You're welcome
It was good seeing you I've missed you
I think I'm going to double my med today. I'm.feeling super depressed
Is that a good idea?
I think it's fine
What if I gave you a chance to go to the gym for an HR when I get home instead?
We are meeting lisa at the park I know you have to work
Just found out I should be home by 930ish
Getting oil changed
Still leave at 4 or can we go earlier
i have good news and I have better news
i can be done at 3:30 and hopefully leave by 4 or 4:30
Ok
the better news is that this is the first week of hours for my new pay scale and i have 56 hrs this week
what where you and the boys going to do for lunch?
Don't know yet
I'm trying to stay out of the house so you can work
ok, thanks for everything you are doing.  if you want you can come home and i'll just close the sliding glass doors
i'll save some of this thai chicken for you in case
You can have the tai chicken
We will be home around 3
ok i threw in all the laundry I could find
its in the dryer now
Most of it was done but thanks
yeah it was only one load with everything from my trip and the stuff from yesterday i guess
5 min wait
Ok
Want me to order Marcos for us?
What do you want?
Why don't we do half buffalo half everything
They don't have Buffalo chicken
Is a meat pizza ok?
I trust you
Scorpion won over lucky
I know it sucks not to come to Legoland with us today. I'm really proud of how hard you're working for your class and for this family.
It's just a short time
OMG this water park is stressful
I'll let you know when I'm done with my test
It's ok we are back at coasters
I just finished my exams
How did it go?
What would you like us to do?
I'm thinking the boys may be too exhausted to eat out. But if you really want to I understand
You might need to get out for a bit
I got a 75 and an 84
That's awesome!!!
Not as good as I was hoping for but better than I deserve
So I'm not complaining
I don't think that's true. Its grwat
I ran out of time on the last test and Christmas trees a quarter of it
I can do whatever is best for the family
Oh wow! That's crazy
There's a Chipotle want me to go there?!
Sure
Ok I know what you like
That's why I love you
We are in line for our last ride
You should go for a swim or a run or something
I'm working on the next chapter
This is the slowest line ever
My feet my feet😭
Awwwww

todo misses you
What ride is it?
Medium caramel iced coffee with milk and 20 munchkins no powdered or plain book
Can you call me
TEC won
I'm really sad for everyone
how's today going?
you guys having fun?
Yes haven't found anything yet
found anything?
No nothing yet
i don't know what you're talking about
We are geocaching
oh right
did you download the app?
Yes
are the kids into it or are they like let's go watch tv?
when i did it with them they were like lets go play a game
They r into it
No TV yet today
well who cares if you find anything if they are into it
that's good but don't hold yourself captive to no tv
We found something!!
no way
awesome
what did you find?
It ended up just being a list of people who found it
you are supposed to take a trinket from the box and leave a new one
perhaps there were more takers than leavers 
Yeah I think
We left one
look at you following the rules
nice
I'ma rules follower
i know me too....
Haha
I have strep
Oh no
Yeah hurts
And I'm worried the boys will get it
Can you stay home today my parents are back pedaling
Yeah
No worries
Thanks
Feel better
do we have plans at 3pm this thursday the 14th?
No
Why?
at some point i said that I was going to be out of the office that day from 3-4.... perhaps it was an allergy shot at some point
Oh ok.
i'm wearing the most comfortable pants
When I get sick I also get depressed as hell please pray for me and pray the kids don't get sick
it sucks that you are sick but this is the best time for it, there is no where you need to be and there is plenty of help around to let you have time to get better
I'm glad you like the pants
they are much cooler
One thing I did right
you do a lot of things well
you should not say such things about yourself.  you are amazing
That's good
i am sorry you are feeling so low you truly are the center of my world
Thanks! Father's day is this weekend. What would you like to.do? Should I send something to your dad
yeah we should get a card
Should I send something to him
i was thinking i would try to take the kids off and give you Saturday to relax.  maybe you could schedule a massage
no i can send a card i just need to remember to pick one up tomorrow morning.
Ok
How r u doing?
ok
it occurred to me last night that I can put a lot of this stuff into an Excel doc and save a crap load of time
Great idea
i'm going to try and make a master excel doc for the last exam that cummulative
how are you doing?
That's awesome!
feeling better?
I really like the liberty program for hr and it's super flexible 8 week classes reasonably priced.
that may be the one we should go with then
I think so
Thanks for being supportive of this career change
i'm sorry i can't do more
are you doing ok?
Yes
Love you. How's your day?
its been an ok day, how about you?
how was the battlebot battle of fury?
the team will be going to WA and to hawaii late july early august
Awesome
if i end up going then we need to make a vacation out of it
I'll be in Charlottesville Virginia with Jude
i'll call in a sec i'm on the phone
i know that you are going to be in charlottesville in July but it may be the beginning of august
i'm so exhausted i want to go home
Can you come home?
i mean technically no one is stopping me but my whole team is still working
Oh bummer
yeah
and tomorrow and friday are likely also going to be crazy
blah
deadlines suck
I'm sorry
I'm a terrible mother. I both miss the kids and am terrified of them coming back
I think that just makes you human
I can't do this life
I think you are, why don't you use the very real condition of you being sick to try and be a little less hands on until you get better
I'm not criticizing you I'm just trying to give you the grace to be human and take a break. You deserve it
I know. I just feel lonely and like I'm screwing everything up.
you aren't screwing anything up
i know you're lonely, i'm sorry i can't be more present
perhaps we could come up with something over the summer like i come home early and we take an hour or two to go for a bike ride or do something as a family
Yeah. I know you have a ton going on. I just don't want you to stop loving me
i won't stop loving you
Promise?
yes
i love you because you are mine
that won't ever change
Bryan just said that we will be "scaling way back on site visits" because of this disclaimer
so maybe no HI and WA
Oh ok that would be good
I'm at black fedora the next two nights is that okay
Can you call me?
It looks like if you could take the 28th we could go for an overnight the 27th to 28th
i don't think it will be a problem but let me get through the deliverable before I ask
Ok
I made the best prime rib burgers ever!!!
Left them for you.
I love you. Sorry I wasn't able to stay longer
That's ok
are these the raviolis from the farmers market?
No Trader Joe's is that okay
they are pretty good
i'm just eating them plain
They just appointed Bill Cohen the missioner of all of these churches that are transitioning
Bill coyne*
lol
the coyne rises again
well i think he likes you for whatever that's worth
Seriously, just let the man retire
i think he doesn't want to
plus that's the great thing about the priesthood
you can litterally work until you are on your deathbed
my granduncle celebrated even when he was too old to stand through the whole eucharistic prayer
they got him a stool
Crazy. We wonder why were losing members
hows the water park?
Josh is in a never ending mood
i've noticed that
i don't know why
Me either
Its stressing me out
it is funny how different the two of them are
Yeah
would you hate me if i came home and took a nap
No right now?
well i think i'm leaving here at 3:30
that will be 9 hrs today
How? You didn't get in till 9
because i worked from midnight to 2:30 this morning
Oh
Totally come home and nap. We are going to take a bike ride.
yeah it makes the hours come fast when you do that
that sounds fun
are you guys having fun?
well really i mean are you having fun
Josh is exhausted we are watching a movie now.
It's been a good day. Games art projects water park bike ride later
Oh and lots of reading
yeah it might not be bad to have a chill inside day to let everyone's bodies catch up with their fun allowance
Yeah
only because you are the best mom ever
and don't forget the math
Yep
yeah i need to catch my breath because i have a test due before midnight tonight and there is just no way right now
Come home and sleep from 4 to 6
k
Just got home where are you?
We went to get ice cream
Be home soon
Okay
i was waiting at the light to get out of our subdivision and when it turned green we went and this cop came out of no where without his lights on and almost rear-ends the person in front of me then turns his lights on to give the guy a ticket
i'm not sure why but it really upset me.
I'm sorry. That does sound scary. Especially on your motorcycle.
Are you okay
i mean i wasn't involved at all but just the arrogance of the cop that he tried to run a red light and then gave a ticket to the other guy for getting in his way
Yeah.
I get it. And there's no checks and balances there.
no.  I kinda wished that I would have stopped too and said I'd testify if the guy went to court
i know it's a small thing but seriously, not fair
Yeah Im sorry
lol you have to hear this
i emailed my professor about the second part of this two part question. which I worked for a long time last night.  It was a table and I couldn't figure out where the numbers came from.
she emailed me back this morning and was like "yeah.... i'm not sure where the numbers in that table came from.  I've never even see that table before.  but you won't have to do it on the exam....."
that's what you call winning
W O W
What a jerk
and then she sent another email like oh i spoke too soon here's the formula but it was the formula for the part of the problem that I didn't ask about
i was like yeah i took hs algerbra too that's not hard
i'm def ready to be done with this class and this teacher
I'm sorry.
This vbs is awful if that helps
bummer.
you think it might just be because it was the first day?
is the first day
Maybe...
i don't think that church has a ton of kids
There's a lot here now
Say something encouraging
i just saved a ton of money on my car insurance by switching to geico
jk
i think that you are doing a great job and you are really good at knowing exactly what the kids need and making that happen for them
you're a great mom and a wonderful wife
Thank you
my bosses forgot to invite me to a meeting that i was supposed to be in... again.... annoying
I'm sorry
no worries just annoying
what nights do you have shows this week?
Tuesday and Friday
I am both terrified that they're not going to find anything in my blood work and that they are going to find something to do my blood work
i understand
i know it has to be scary to know something is wrong but not know what
i'm about to submit this vacation request for Thursday the 28th right?
Whatever the test says you don't have to handle it alone
If you want we leave the 30th
i just got approved
Ok
Do you want to go overnight somewhere or just plan a date??
let's go somewhere.  i think it would be good for you to get out of the house
I'm looking at prices...it's like 200 maybe we should just do a nice date
i understand the money concern but this is the last time i'll see you for a month
True do you want to go to Middleton place look it up it's gorgeous!
yes
you've been talking about it for some time i know you'd like it that's all i need to know
do you want me to schedule it?
Sure Wednesday night to Thursday
Actually you have a lot going on I'll do it
I booked it
i finished my quizzes
i got an 80 and a 100, yay me
i did the math.  I need a 50% to get a C on the final and a 77% to get a B
Good job
Why doesn't anyone want me
There's all these places that need ministry but I'm never good enough.
Why do you say that?
Did you talk to the bishop?
I don't think whether ppl want you is a good marker as to how good you are either as a person or as a priest
I'm sobbing on this conference call. Only good enough to cook and clean no one wants me for anything else
That's not true. The Church is broken right now it isn't you it is them
It's fine I'm useless every where. No good to anyone
Of it makes you feel any better you are doing g much better as a priest than I did
That's not true you are amazing and beautiful and worthy. You are beloved and smart and kind and intelligent and funny
Some old dude who will be remembered on as part of splitting the church apart doesn't get to determine your self worth
Everything going on right now is about the brokenness of the Church not the importance or worthy of you or your ministry
Look in your heart you know it's true
Things are pretty good in our life and that is in large part to you. Our kids are great our marriage is great and you have a position that is easy for you and in which ppl think you literally walk on water
You are making in roads at PG and you've only spent a year there
You have a friend in Lisa and the women over in your parents neighborhood
It is possible that they are telling you no because of God's protection over you
Maybe. I just feel awful like I'm not worth anything but a 1950s house wife
Well, I don't think that's true nor do I think that a 1950s housewife was worthless. Families were happier divorce rates were lower and kids were less disfunctionalcthan when we grew up, but that's besides the point. You have many talents and skills you just happen to be working for two disfunctional systems so I can understand why you might feel lost
I think what is feeling like failure to us is actually God's protection
I hated the way I left St James but I am so thankful not to be there for all this craziness
I think time may show the same for you
i'm sorry that you are hurting
R u up?
Jude "I'm designing an important image" josh "it's called coloring"
Lol
That basically sums up our kids
when do the kids go to your parents?
They just left
what are you going to do with your new freedom?
Clean, pray
I think you should pray and sleep
that's what i'd do
You wanna come out?
There are spouses here
I'm with Lisa sorry
I didn't know
Yeah I knew that actually totally forgot sorry. Hope y'all have fun
I just finished up with the team..... I really don't understand the bar thing
What day do you actually take your test
Are you hanging with Chris this Saturday?
No apparent it is Sunday
They are both due by tomorrow at midnight
I was planning on taking them tomorrow
Ok
Ok
he wants me to go with him now to myrtle beach but i don't want to do that
i'd rather spend the time with you guys
i'll help him get it into his house
Whatever you want
i want to spend as much time as I can between Saturday and the following Sunday  with you guys before you leave
or whenever you are leaving
Would you be willing to do one day with the boys before we go so I could have a hot second
yes
that sounds great
maybe i'll take them to Myrtle Beach
That would be awesome
are you stressed?
Why
?
you sound stressed and i was worried about you
No I'm good. Just starting to think about five weeks alone
Theres a job in Maryland near DC that would be awesome for me. If we were going closer to company head quarters think you could get a transfer?
yes
i think i could make it happen
I'm.going to apply
If it's ok with you
you should
where in maryland?
Severna park md
I love you
I don't know 8f I can pull this out
I'm so exhausted
Maybe you should just come home and go to bed early stay up late tomorrow yo get it done
I have so much left to cover and I have to start taking it by 8
2 tests 2 hrs each
I'm sorry
How can I help I could bring u food?
No, just pray I can keep it together.
Ok
I love you
I'm not going to pass this class
Why what's going on
Apparently I need to subtract my three quiz lowest grade
So I need to get a 100 on this test to pass the class is what it looks like
How is it possible that I work this hard and still don't pass
That can't be right before you panic why don't you email the teachee
I did
What did she say
she said that i definitely do have to subtract the three lowest scores
Dear God, you are so much more powerful than we can possibly imagine. You know what we need and you deliver in your promise that we are not alone. Guide Andrew today as he takes his final tests. Help him have the power of Jesus I him as he muscles through this final day.
thank you
You hang in there
Yeah I'm almost done studying
Warning we are on our way home we are on our way home
You forgot the bag of snacks and entertainment
Do you want to stop by and get it
My tests are normal I just looked it up. On the low side but normal. I guess that's good news
Josh just said the car in front of us is quote Indian red and quote
Oh god
I just lost the entire resume I spent 2 hours creating
Are you sure?
Yes my life sucks
There might be another one of your resumes on our old computer
I suck this is so hard and I leave in a week.and I'm scared
Just one thing at a time you'll be great

I needed that
Resumes sent!
You're awesome
When do you think you'll be home
I mowed the front lawn but I'm leaving the jungle to you
Your children just said they like cicis better than lasers
Where did we go wrong as parents?????
Lazers took longer than we expected eta 9
Well sleep in tomorrow
Ok nbd
Did you have a good day today?
Yes! How about you?
Yeah, I think we had a good day
2 tireds coming in hot
I cleaned your car as much as you can clean a car that old
You're amazing you didn't need to do that
I am amazing
hows the water park?
Good. Dr pullano says extreme anxiety really might be causing my mom's memory loss
that's good except she has nothing to be anxious about so if that is the cause it means it's just who she is
maybe they can give her happy pills
She's already on some
oh
Bryan said someone called him and asked if we wanted to participate in a fundraiser "$5 Jeans day" and he didn't have the heart to tell them that we wear jeans every day
Lol
Bryan just passed shorts and flip flop Fridays
Nice
you guys worn out?
We are good working on math and writing now
I'm so angry at brain balance.
They are totally blowing me off despite the whole phase 2 will change you life crap
yeah i think we need to be done with Brain Balance.  It got us through the first phase and now we are on to new and better things
I feel played like I totally messed up
you didn't mess up
i think it made a difference
but i think that we are now experiencing the law of diminishing returns
What's that?
you know, do something once and its great but do it too much and not as good
like 1 cookie great 100 cookies gonna be sick
or brand new job is hard and challenging old job boring and uneventful
so what time did you want me hom?
i know i said i'd be home as soon as work was over but i'm thinking i might want to wait out this storm
I'm supposed to leave at like 6:15 but just yeah I don't want you driving in the storm
I really don't like it when people assume I like they're huge dogs up in my face
sorry
i agree that it is important to train a dog well esp when they are bigger
He was a nice dog but no pre warning like he's nice don't worry. Freaking pit bull mix
Random but importabt question... Will the bike rack fit onto the van so I can bring our bikes to Charlottesville VA
yes it will
and yes you can
also, Lazer is a genius
I know I know
I might just have to give up on this day
i think that's fine
take a break you don't have to go every minute of the day.  you guys had a busy morning

Bike trail
i totally have no idea where you guys are
Bike trail by earth fare
how was the ride?
It was good
I think my black fedora show is probably cancelled
I didn't know if you worked a couple of extra hours today if you could leave early tomorrow so we can go to Middleton Place early
well i'm hoping to be leaving in an hour either way
maybe we can have a family movie night
I'm headed home
It's 11: 00 at night. I am just leaving
It makes me nervous to go on a date with you😢
don't be nervous, its just me
I feel like I'm never good enough for you
I don't want to mess up tonight
you are better than i deserve
i love you for you.... go to the room and take a bath and just relax
Ok I have to get these brain balance results first

lol
Just calling you back
Can't wait to see you tonight!!!
It's really pretty here
I forgot NyQuil and deodorant. Thanks!
Text me so I know you got this
I got it
I think you have the keys to both vehicles, I'll just take my bike
Oh bummer sorry
I don't see your deodorant, you want me to pick some up for you?
It's in the pool bag.
Also gate code is 3665
Do you know where the NyQuil is
Found it
Downstairs bathroom
Should I change a reservation to 8 for dinner
Or we could just order room service
I'm headed out now
Ok
We are done with the packing we can do today
We're headed home
I love you
How's your head?
A little better
Good, we'll be back in About 45min
Ok maybe we will cancel pineapple fountain and do a movie night I'm warning out and have a conversation with Callie tomorrow morning. The arch deacon from the diocese
That's great I thought maybe she blew you off
Headed home now
She's late. She didn't call expects me to wait. I rushed like a crazy woman through beach traffic to get here on time. Sorry just needed to vent
Ps she has my phone she could texted called!
Ahhhh
That is annoying
Yes yes it is
It's possible I am drowning my feelings and in an absurd amount of macaroni and cheese
i'm sorry, it will get better
Already is...
Yum yum.
yes but now you will have to deal with the wrath of Josh
Lol
you know how he is about food
True
i've been trying to get friends together for the 4th but it isn't going to happen
Why not?
no one is interested i don't think
Bummer I'm sorry
i'm sure i can find something to do
maybe i'll try to put the roof back on the tree house and clean out the garage
Sounds boring I'm sure you can get an invite somewhere
i only have two actual friends and neither seems interested
i'm not worried about it
I'm sorry.
the server went out so we are playing hangman
lol
Fun
we're back to work
turns out the IT issue was somehow his fault
something about renewing his RSA token?
Ok
I'm still a mess turns out mac and cheese only helps for a minute
yeah, i'm sorry
i wouldn't worry about it
there will be a place for you
i'm trusting that God is protecting us from this mess
Hey Bae I'm getting ready to head home
Okay Lisa hurt her face while we're at the pool and had to go get stitches so I have all 5 boys at the house
We have an hour left in the car and the kids are screaming their faces off and might not be able to survive this
You've got this
But really I don't
I believe in you
You're a great mom
I think you are amazing
We are here
That was fast
Really felt like forever
Forgot the jeans can you bring them to my parents?
Yes, just leaving Walmart now
Leaving Walmart now
Thank you
This is no big deal no sweat. Is there anything else you might need
I think I'm good just shaky
You're a great parent and a great mom trust in yourself
The thing 8s Jude doesn't really wear a lot of jeans
I found one pair and then two pairs of other long pants
Hmmm there should be two pairs in his bottom drawer no?
If not check the closet
I checked the closet and the bottom drawer I finally found a pair that might fit in Josh's room
Size7
Ok well if not I can try and buy some just wrong time of year
I know that is what I was thinking
Yes
I am taking 3 pairs of pants to your parents house, I think one of them will work
Ok
Sounds good
I think we need to figure out a time we can talk each day. I'm going to need a daily check in
Let's wait until you get Jude's schedule. I'd love to check in first thing around 730ish and then around bedtime
Ok.
I'll call after church
Ok we r good nbd

How we spent the last hour
That's super fun. I should take them to the upstate and we could build survival shelters and stay in them for the night
Sooo fun

How we spent the last hour
Can you find the Oakland handbook in one if the kitchen drawers? I want to make sure he has everything
I don't see anything Oakland related in any of the drawers
Hmm...ok
I don't think I ever got the handbook
I'm sure they'll have an extra
It will be ok, your a great parent
Ok
sorry for missing your call this morning is crazy with everything being new and I don't know where I'm going. I'll call you later
I figured it would be, I was just hoping I was gonna get you before the crazy set in but no worries.
All dropped off and ready! What horse did you ride at Oakland
Otto, I'd guess he isn't there now
He was large and ornery, there weren't very many who could ride him
I don't think I can do this
Why what happened?
I don't know
Don't forget quiet time in the afternoon to give yourself a chance to breathe
You're a great mom, give yourself a break
It's not that I just can't find a home base. Like the water park. A place I can take josh I know we'll have fun could spend the day
I don't know, I'm sure a lot has changed since I was there. We used to go to the downtown mall which wasn't really a mall but a shaded walk area with shops
I remember there was a place that served Italian ice
Ok
And there was a restaurant named 'the hardware store' that made a pretty decent burger
We'd go Everytime my parents came
Looks like there's an indoor water park at massanutten. No clue how far that is from you though
I went for a run this morning, now I can't walk
I took a nap I feel better
I need you to tell me it's okay I just spent a ton of money between grocery shopping and stuff to needed for camp
i know.  it's fine.  it costs money to live we can't fear spending money on necessities.  we'll be fine
Ok
i'm glad you got a nap
did Josh nap too?
No
that kid wouldn't take a nap if his eyes were falling out of his head
at least he let you nap
What's the Hulu login
jillwilliams5678@hotmail.com Florida00
more run around with this CPA stuff
i swear i've never heard of so many SNAFUs with one process
What happened now?
God's teaching me to be proactive
Oh ok
i emailed today to follow up with the state board and they said "oh didn't you get the email, they said they were going to email you that the problem was at the school"
so i called the school and they were like no the problem is at the clearing house and I was like no they said the problem was with you.  so they said we'll call you back after we research this.
at this point i don't believe that anyone will call me back when they say they will so i'm going to call the school again at 2:30
Oh ok
I know that's frustrating!
they actually called me back!
it's nice to find that not all ppl suck
she said they couldn't send an electronic one but that they would mail out a hard copy on Thursday
Ok
That's not terrible. These are long days
Up at 6 bed at 830
yeah.  you guys are off on a hike today right?
We hiked from 9 to 11
was it fun?
how did Josh like the great outdoors?
It was he did well.
But now theres a whole afternoon
i'd do some math and reading and then let him chill for the rest of the afternoon so he doesn't get too exhausted.
you are doing a great job, you're an amazing parent.

Ginormous naked chess wins
that looks like so much fun, i bet it is expensive
Just played basketball for two hours at the gym after the uphill hike. I'm going to look amazing
you already look amazing
but be honest, did Josh win?
Yes he did
lol
just wait until he's 7 feet tall and 270 lbs
😊
and you can say, i birth that thing without any drugs
lol
Right
Just when I think I have it together they throw me a curveball
what happened?
It's fine they want him in red white and blue tomorrow
whatever these are nice suggestions not mandates i wouldn't sweat it
I figured it out. There's just a lot of traffic this time of day
And I'm exhausted
The end of the day is hard, esp when you're a morning person
Exactly
Did I mention that prime has both Chuck and Dawson's Creek
No I didn't know that
My computer won't find the network of this house any suggestions?
My phone and Kindle found it no problem
Yeah that's weird, I wonder if my computer is having that same problem here
Do you know where Molly's bark collar is
No sorry
Ummm fruit bowl or ypstaris on chest
Upstairs
Yeah just thought I'd ask
Am I crazy for bringing kids to fireworks at 9pm
No you're being the fun parent
I'd try to get a nap in though either today or super early to bed tomorrow
Ok
The days are long here....
Yeah
Feeling a little lonely how r u
I miss you
You too
Bean,that jerk chicken marinade in the fridge is awesome!
Oh good
Molly just ate a cicada
Bleck
I'm for sure paying the price for those fireworks today
Lol
How are the kids doing
Fine just tired and cranky
There's had so much fun last night though
I'm kinda a mess today
why?
you mean emotionally or just you can't get your stuff straight
Emotionally I think I'm just exhausted there's no breaks you know?
yeah, it sounds like you guys have been going full bore.  you might want to have a nap time for a couple of days until everyone catches up on sleep
Yeah josh just won't settle I think he's nervous being a new place yesterday he was really missing Jude
yeah they are basically always together
Yeah it's fine I'm ok
i know you'll figure it out but that doesn't stop me from worrying about you
It's ok. I'm working out now we are just going to walk around downtown later
the mall is a little bit cooler because it is shady.  it will be nice
Yeah
I figured we'll find coffee a d a cookie and just kinda chill
yeah, i think i went to an italian ice place on the mall once as a field trip
i think it is possible that the greatest thing that's happened to me this year is linen
I just got an email asking for an estimate of which days i want to take both for CPE and vacation
frustrating....  i think i'd like to put in for Christmas eve and the day after christmas and then how many days is thanksgiving going to be?
So I feel super guilty because I feel like if we know Jude is successful at Oakland how can we make h go back? U know?
i understand where you are coming from but him going to oakland full time is not a financial possibility right now
i think we have a good plan to do the best that we can for him
I know. I just have to be so on top of everything. It's hard I wish we could get him reading now and then just worry about extra time etc at school. There are educational loans. You think I'm being dumb I knoe
i don't think you're being dumb it just makes me nervous to think about going into debt
Me too but not as nervous as watching Jude loose self esteem and get more and more behind in school
Shit! I have the stomach flu
Oh no!
Do you need a doctor
No. I'm just throwing up
You should go to bed
Yeah I'll go to bed with the kids
I'm so sorry
It's fine I pushed too hard
I'm trying too hard and it's never enough
It's enough, give yourself a break
You can take a break
I hope your feeling better this morning
You and Josh should stay in bed and watch too much TV
That's one of the things stressing me out I feel like or watching TV
It's ok your sick and sometimes they just need to chill
Y'all have had a bunch of full days
I feel like weve been having too much screen time. Josh is either Full Throttle or watching TV
In general getting him to read and do math everyday is really hard I do it but...
Yeah, unfortunately I think that's normal. You are amazing though. I am proud and thankful that you are so dedicated and great at being a mom
If you aren't feeling well just let it all go for a day. Josh's whole education won't go to pot if you take a day or two to get better
Im feeling better just lonely, confused.
maybe we could come up with some way to talk and stay connected even though there's distance
like we could play words with friends or something
Sure
i mean, if you think it would help
i don't want you to be lonely and i miss you too.  I'd like to stay connected
Sure
also, i was just thinking if i'm going to fly up I should probably book my ticket.  doesn't have to be a right away thing but maybe this weekend we can nail down a date and I'll schedule flights/hotels/ whatever
Ok
are you guys having a chill day today?
Not really
oh are you doing anything fun?  probably off to the Y
Gym and then a jumping place
It's rainy today
bummer
Molly has been extra clingy, i think she misses you guys
That's sweet.
what did jude say about horseback riding?
He hasn't ridden yet we're hoping today. He groomed the first day
ahhh
what did he think of the grooming?
He liked it
He's really doing well
i knew he would, Oakland is a magical place and he's good at making friends
Yeah. I just wish he could stay until they felt he was ready to go all this back and forth is really taking it's toll on all of us.
yeah, next year we will look at boarding
I'm.hoping they'll know him enough by the end of the summer to tell me what might be best for him and then we can take next year to get that in place
Is Josh worn out yet?
Not yet
We just went yo the park and are thinking swimming tonight
wow
you guys should slow down or you'll all get sick
it does sound like you are having fun though
Dude comes home from camp in the worst mood screaming how he hates everyone
Oh no! Why????
I think he's just exhausted. But it makes everything so much harder
I'm sorry
Are you still going swimming
I figured out the vacuum so that's one win today!!!
Lol

Can you look for those they are due at library
Any hints?
I'm thinking downstairs but no not really sorry
Are they in the normal CD cases
DVD cases from library
K I'll look
Thanks
I definitely did not lock myself out of the house this morning and have to go through the whole neighborhood to my car in my pajamas to get back in
Lol
Poor bean
Right
Ok so can you look up flights for next weekend
191
Round trip
?
Yes
No baggage
I'd get in around 7 and I'd leave at 630 pm the next day
We can get a 2 bedroom sweet at a Residence Inn with a queen bed in each bedroom for 208
Stupid talk to text, suite***
How much is it for you to fly to Charlottesville
Hold please
I could get in Friday night at 9pm and leave Sunday at 7pm for318
I'm sure there's taxes and whatnot still but that's about it
I could get a cheaper hotel in DC but I was trying to make the residence inn work
I know you like the kitchen and this one is walking distance from the metro
Hilton in mark center Alexandra?.
Yeah, I think that's right next to my office
Or we could do an embassy suites at Dulles airport if that's where your flying into that might be the most convenient
No, I fly into regan
Ok
So Hilton then? Or keep looking?
The Hilton there is nice that's fine with me
Ok it's booked it cost 30 with discount and that includes breakfast
So what if I'm never anything again. You know like never a priest or a anything what if all I get to be now is a mother a wife. Will I ever feel like it's enough or will I always feel like I missed out on me.
I think there's time for everything, there just isn't time to do it all right now
What of you asked the question backwards. What of you became a priest and missed the kids growing up? I know it is hard and overwhelming but you aren't in the place that you are by accident either physically or metaphorically. You have thought and then worked hard to be a good mom and an amazing wife. And you are really great at both
I promise you will serve in a church again and you will be great at that also just give yourself some grace
I washed a section of the carpets and the water was black, yuck
I'm gonna do the rest before y'all coming.e home
Hard to believe with how much we vacuum
Thanks I appreciate you
I want you guys to be excited to come home
I will say I'm loving how easy cleaning is to keep up with in this town house

Enjoying the cool Virginia morning
It's actually somewhat cool here too with a nice breeze
I don't believe you lol
Note the gentle breeze

I love pizza day
Josh spilled milk all over the van
Nice
That sucks
At least it wasn't real milk
I'm just saying enjoy yourself ur nice wuiet pizza and start wars movie.
😂
They say vinegar water spray and leave the windows open
Found this
Use a spray bottle and mix four parts water to one part vinegar. Spray the spill area until it is drenched with the vinegar mixture. Allow it to soak for five hours and then blot it dry with aclean washcloth or towel. It's best to leave the vehicle windows open to allow it to air out.
I'm sorry
Ok thank you. I'm good
Is it ok if I order pizza for the kids and I tonight?
Can you just tell me I don't suck at life
Yes, eat pizza watch a movie and enjoy being with each other
You are a great mom, the fact that Josh is still alive is proof of that
I can count 6 holes in my arm from these stupid shots
I'm sorry how much longer do you have to do them
Not too much longer, like 2 yrs
Lol
Oh god
Vinegar and water works like a charm thank you
Josh says he's freezing it's 66 degrees
Dude is worried I'm going to embarrass him in front of his friends
Tell him not to worry about that.... Of course you are going to embarrass him, that is the joy of parenthood
Yeah it was cool here this morning too. Probably not 66 degrees but maybe 70-75 with a breeze
I went for a run and the sweat on my face was cold
That's awesome!
are you sure that the movies were checked out using your card?
i'm in your account and it looks like there are two books but that's it
Yes
Awesome then I returned it and am smarter than I thought
funny story
I have one book I wanted to finish I'm sending it back with my parents and you found the other right
one of the books you have checked out is titled haunted by a guy named balthazar
so i was thinking van balthazar but no
it is this young justice book that I have
No lol
do you have that bad blood book that you were reading?
I'm glad I didn't screw that up
Yes
i thought you were probably on top of it
if you finish it before this weekend i can return it for you
it is due the 20th
although your parents are going back down so maybe that would be better for you
I just finished so I'm sending it back with them
perfect
do you want me to look for another book by jennifer barnes?
No I'm going to check out the library today
actually i guess that won't work, i don't have a card
ok sounds good
Hopefully they'll let me check out
How was your day?
ok
it went crazy fast
That's good
there is always a mini panic day on Mondays
we have a status meeting where we say what has to be done by the end of the month and what we have done so far and everyone is like CRAP
Lol accountants are good at time management huh
well the thing is that there are these ginormous documents that will never be completed it is like how much can you cram into it
Oh ok
but yeah we could be better at time management
it is like a whole company of me
lol
Good morning
Haven't heard from you in a while you mad?
No I was beat last night
Oh ok. You feeling better today?
Yeah I'm just bored I think
Have you checked on your NTS
i fixed the problem last tuesday and they said they would mail it on Thursday because of the 4th
they were mailing it from greenville to columbia which is probably 2-3 days
so I'd say they received my transcripts yesterday or today
i might check on it thursday or friday is what i was thinking.  that should give them time to receive and have looked at it
you are right though, i probably should start refreshing for my test
I'm just thinking that if your bored... If you're still tired though that's a different story
no, i've been exercising and trying to lose some weight and my body hates me for it
Oh. Maybe don't go so hard
I'm not going to look different just more tired
poor bean, i'm sorry. i know it has been hard work but i'm really proud of you facing your fear and all
i know you were very anxious about being on your own with the kids
what are you guys going to do today?
We are bird watching this morning
you think josh will be into that?
He just got binoculars
lol
of course
when did your parents leave?
This morning. I'm kind of sad.
why
I'm just all alone again. And I can leave my mom's not doing great
you'll be home before you know it
and it will be broken up.  you'll see me in 4 days and and your parent will be back up next weekend
Yeah. I was okay yesterday today feels bad
I'm sorry
i get it, its hard to be apart
Yeah
i do miss you
I miss you too
Jude has allergies he looked miserable going to camp today. I gave him some medicine I hope he's ok
one of the perks of going to different climates is that your allergies kick up
he's outside a lot of the day
what did your parent's think of the horses?
They were pretty impressed by everything
the board just emailed 
they said i got my NTS finally and someone will be in touch with the actual NTS number and other details
Yay!!!
yeah that's good news
i'll start studying today 
Awesome
i can't believe it took so long
I think we'll all feel so much better when you're more secure with your CPA
agreed
it will open up options
a girl in my office just passed her last test last month
Well that's all good
If you get a chance could you give me a call sometime today
we had a two hour staff meeting
Oh wow everything ok?
yeah
it was cool even though it is going to mean i lose time today
he bought us lunch and just recapped the year like this is where we've been now where are we going
Bummer is he happy with everyone
yeah
How did Josh like the birds
That lasted 20 minutes
Then we went back to the orchard for a kids program they were having. We went to the gym and then came home and made peach crisp.
Josh helped cut the peaches. I finally feel better. Took me a long time to shake the blues this morning.
I love you
Jude couldn't steer his horse today. He didn't like lunch and doesn't want to go back. Think you could talk to him about how it takes time to learn to ride a horse?
Also could you come punch me in the face I think that's the only thing that would make this day worse
We knew that him eating lunch there was going to stretch him. That's the point. It will be ok. And horses being stubborn is not uncommon but I promise he was in no danger
Good morning
Morning
I got to work and realized I forgot my fob and my keys
Did you have to go home?
Yes
Bummer
I can't get in the building or in my computer without them
Are you working from home today
No
I had an appointment tgough
I like to think of it as an opportunity to enjoy twice as much motorcycle riding
That's good
I'm beat today. Like I don't even know what I need kinda beat
What are y'all up to today
Sounds like a day at the pool to me
At the gym now then I don't know what
Let Josh play in the water and you can read
Josh doesn't want to get wet
The boys are Always fighting
that was true before
they have a strange relationship
they love to play together but they are also always fighting
I know but this is vicious like I just want to make you suffer fighting
they are boys
they are going to be aggressive
Yeah ok. I want to buy a new shirt ...
you should
I might
I'm.super excited for this weekend
me too
i can't wait to see you guys
Me too
i also think the kids are gonna love DC
i'm actually most excited to see them on the metro
Yeah. Ps they really do have sandwiches everyday for lunch
maybe
that sounds vaguely familiar to me
he can make a PB&J though i'd guess
and eating a PB&J every day for lunch sounds like his normal diet
It's p nut free now
really?
And they don't have soynut I mean we will figure it out but I'm.glad he's not like fibbing to me.
i guess i'm not surprised but that's obviously new
Right.
they shouldn't decrease the peanut butter they should increase the eppy pens and drive on
lol
Right
you know, when i was there they used to put sugar in their spaghetti sauce until all the kids got together and asked them to stop
Lol
we were all seriously though save the sugar for the cookies and leave our sauce alone
They serve kale and broccoli now
they always served broccoli but the kale i think is new
it wasn't the best food but you know, you go away to school and all of the food is basically the same
not great but not disgusting
what did you guys settle on for today?
We played for making and now we are exploring an outdoor mall
oh fun
i'm glad josh is getting some alone time with you
i think he needed that
I think so too
Was hoping to find something for me found a bunch of stuff on sale for back to school nothing for me🙄
life just isn't fair
I know
you look good even if you don't have a new shirt
Thanks sometimes it just helps that do one small thing for me like 5: 30 to feel like myself again
Buy a shirt*
I just got lost and everybody else's needs
i understand
When you get a chance I have a few things I need you to bring me.
can you text me the list?
or email works too
Mostly I just need my meds from Walgreens. But could you bring any gift certificates I have too?
yes
are the meds ready to pick up now?
Yes
ok i'll go today so i don't forget
Thank you
Just booked my hotel room for coming home 80 including breakfast.
Nice
I think there is literally a 30 degree difference between I side my office and outside
That's crazy
Lisa's hubby, Marcus, just lost his job.
OH NO
that's not good at all
what are they going to do?
Yeah...
did they buy that house?
He's going to have to start looking
Yes
what does he do?
I told her she could use our house during the day if he needed a quiet spot or she needed a place for the kids
Insurance broker
hmmmm
everyone says he is just like me maybe that
that's not a good fit for him
Is that ok?
insurance is all commission
fine with me
Yeah...
the front door is unlocked just tell them to be gentle with molly
I know. Apparently he was doing pretty well not sure what happened .
ok
i wish i knew someone in the insurance biz
Ok. If you can find a way to reach out to him that would be awesome!
that's not going to work
i mean i'd love to but we haven't exchanged two words i can't all the sudden call and be like let's talk about this thing that you are probably really anxious and embarrassed about
Yeah I get it
However they can come over here and I'm more than happy to .ake meals
Thank you!
If he wants the contact info for my interview coach I can give that too
That would be awesome!
I had a really bad panic attack today. Now it's 9pm I'm exhausted to s left to do can't sleep
i'm sorry
did jude have a better day today?
Yes
that's good.
i'm making chicken
Yum...can we go to Cosi in dc
it's a new recipe so we'll see
yes but we will have to drive
they have closed a bunch of them
i think there's one in dulles which is not helpful, one in crystal city (maybe) and one in arlington
Oh forget it then
Just tell me I'm going to be okay
you will be good
i'm very proud of you for going with the kids this summer and facing your fear
if you want cosi we can get cosi
this recipe is for mayonnaise parm chicken
Hmmm
Was it good?
It's ok you don't taste mayo you taste the cheese
What are you watching
Reading
Good morning
Morning!
When did you finally get to bed?
330
Beano.... That's not good
How are you feeling
I'm ok.
You need your sleep
You should take it easy today
I'll be ok.
I made this really stupid mistake last night and I think it just get me up
ok
these shots make my arm hot
what is your plan for the day?
Bleck. We are headed to gym then I made the stupid mistake of inviting this crazy woman over. Which is totally stressing me out
So I have to get ready for that.
what crazy woman
the one next door?
no the one from Oakland She's Got 5 kids between the ages of one and nine and they are living in a hotel until her house is ready
Since then her husband had to travel for work this week
So I told her I would have her over for dinner
you and her basketball team
But shes super High Strung and it makes me really stressed out
i'm sure it will be nice to have other ppl around though
It would be good if we weren't in this townhouse but there is so much breakable stuff
For kids eat a time that I just don't know where I'm going to get the money for this food
Her kids eat a ton*
it will be ok
I know. It's totally irrational to be this worried about it
do the kids play well together
Jude likes max but they spent most of the time telling on Josh
well the woman has a bazillion kids Josh should be able to pick a different kid to be friends with
Yeah it will be fine. I know I'm being irrational
There's just something about her personality that puts me on edge
She reminds me of my mother when my mother is being crazy
i'm sorry
maybe she isn't the right fit for a friend
I feel like I can't really judge her for her crazy situation right now
So I'm just trying to be kind
I miss you
i miss you too
I want someone to take care of me for a minute
i know you have had long days for a while
Yeah
It's chest and triceps back and biceps right.
You should see me I'm gonna be ripped
that is correct
push days and pull days
i wrote out carbon copy in these minutes and the guy above me, who is younger than me, goes carbon what?
Lol you're old
for real
did i tell you i can sleep with the fan on now
Thats great
yeah i haven't been able to do that for a while
it's good that I have some tangible sign that the shots are working because it is not fun having my arms itch all the time
Yeah I'm sorry
what are you guys up to today?
Gym, clean, Lego time, pool, crazy lady coming over
lol
that sounds like a full day
i'm gonna try to get a little extra time in today
and then tomorrow is going to be crazy i have to go home after work mow and pick up the dry cleaning
I am trying to be deligent about limited screen time
Sounds good
bryan is a total extrovert so he worked hard and got the "corner office" and found out that it was lonely so he comes out to talk all the time
i think there's irony in there somewhere
i wouldn't kill yourself with the screen time thing
it's the summer and they are doing math and reading to stay fresh if they want to veg or you need a minute it will be ok
Yeah but still I try
that's fine just don't stress about it
you have enough to worry about without adding things
Awesome thanks!
whas that for me?
No sorry
didn't think so
i want to hear all about your dinner tonight
Yeah . . gonna be awesome
lol i think it will be good for you to take to someone who doesn't want anything from you
Everyone wants something
yes but it sounds like all this woman wants is not to be alone
True
Bunch of houses in shadowmoss were broken into you should lick the doors at night
yeah and during the day really
bryan was just telling me about that
Yeah crazy
it's ok though, molly will protect us
Riiiiiight
ppl are scared of molly, she's scary
Can't wait to see you tomorrow
Me too
So Jude came home with 3 pages of math
That's weird I never had homework over the summer
I know. He also didn't get an award for the week but I haven't heard from anyone so...
Did you ask Jude about it?
Yeah
He says it got a lot harder
Hmm ok
I don't know.
Jude had a total meltdown before camp
Why
I don't really know. He said something happened in math class. I think his allergies are acting up and he's not feeling good. And he said he misses you
I get that
It is hard to be in a new place
Yeah. I told him if he still doesn't feel good after lunch you can call me and I pick him up
The afternoon is all extra curricular
What time do you pick him up?
4: 30
Anyway I figured it out
Would it help if I called this afternoon?
they have put a recurring meeting at 4 o'clock on a friday
Ewwww
Do you think I'm messing everything up?
you aren't messing anything up
it is hard to be away it puts you out of sorts and this is a new place
You're right
things will be better next year
i promise it is hard but there are also some amazing moments scattered inbetween the hard
Can you call me when you get a sec
You ok?
Sorry I was in a meeting
I can just tell them no for this interview
don't do that
I want you to go
I can tell you want to stay where we are
i am happy that you got the opportunity
no, that isn't the case at all
i just don't want a crazy long commute and some of the places on the DC Maryland border aren't great
those are the two barriers that I see but we can work around those I'm sure
I'm here
I'm on the road without coffee so we may or may not make it
Yeah, don't do that it's not worth it
I left without breakfast.... Sooo hungry
I was just bamboozled!!!
I went to chick fill a for breakfast and the don't have the sauce
I almost cancelled my order
#not worth it
Where do you want to meet. I'm an hour out
John Carlyle square, it's near Duke street
I was wrong about the hotel. It isn't the one I was thinking
Is there a place to park
Yes
I walked here from the king Street metro
Ok
Let me know when your close, I'm kinda tucked away out of the sun
6 minutes out where exactly are you
By the fountain
In the transformer game near bathroom
Passing my old stomping grounds at the CIA
Lol
Good news, I found my flight
Bad news it has been delayed again, now leaving 707
Good news I made it out of DC bad news it's pouring
That's just because God thought you'd like a car wash. It's multitasking
I miss you guys already
On the plane the delay got moved forward so that's good
That's great
Yeah, nbd except I feel bad for Molly
You can call my dad
No I'm not worried about feeding her, I don't like her to be alone
Oh
Sorry
Just landed
Me too can't move can't think can only sit here and sob
Awww I'm sorry bean what's going on?
I'm tired and lonely and tired and lonely
Yeah I know you've had a lot going on. I am sorry there wasn't more time for you to rest in DC
It's ok. I mean I wanted to spend time with you I'm just exhausted
I made it in and out of Walmart in 30 mins
And only spent 54 for groceries, only God knows how
Awesome!
Im just here no food in the house alone... crying
I'm sorry bean
You should try to go to bed. Everything is better in the morning
I'll try
We're the boys exhausted by the time you got back?
Exhausted in that let me be a total brat kinda way
That's their favorite way to be tired though
Just had my allergy shot and I told her about my whole arm itching. She's like yeah that happens
So Josh has ring worm
That sucks
Does anyone else have it
Not yer
that's good
luckily the meds are cheap and over the counter
is that what all that red blotchiness was?
Maybe
you should tell the Y
I I haven't been getting any emails from Oakland. Turns out I miss like 20. Including ones that the Judes not been doing a very good job
Where we're the emails going
What do you mean not been doing a good job?
I don't know i looked everywhere I can't find them in my Hotmail.
So I switched to Google and they sent me everything I missed
Oh
Well at least we have the emails now
Apparently he's been rushing his reading work and they can't get him to do better
That doesn't make sense to me
Why?
They can't or they just don't want to try
She said they put an assistant with him and he still wouldn't do it.
It seems to me in a smaller class the teacher should have the time to sit down with him and address the issue
He's refusing to read
Nothing is working. I'm failing I can't help him.
I don't think that you are failing
Do you want me to talk to him
I think I handled it
This isn't your fault Jude has a genetic disability you didn't cause that
I just hate seeing him struggle...
And it is exhausting to fight it everyday, he just needs to understand that fighting now will mean an easier life later
Ok well let me know I'm happy to talk to him
He wanted to quit horse riding. I told him he had to try one more time. I told him horses can smell fear and he needed to take Charge
More importantly, don't go inside your head. Ultimately all we can do is provide opportunities and encourage him. He'll have to find the fight inside himself to make it happen
Good
He did it and he was do proud. I told him reading is like that. It's scary and hard ...he can hide or quit but it feels better to conquer it. We will see if it works
You have give our kids every opportunity you are a great .om
Mom
I can't stop crying
I know but this isn't your fault
How was vbs
I can't be his mom. I'm not good enough
I think it is important to point out that this is not a terminal disease. Even if he gets no more help and he is just sorta pushed through school he will be fine. He'll be your dad.
We are talking about the difference of making a 6 figure salary as a blue collar worker or making a 6 figure salary as a white collar worker
Yeah ok. I don't care I just want him to be happy
He won't die, his life won't be over, he will still have options.
Ok...please say a prayer that my pep talk worked
Ok
Can you try to figure out my Skype name?
good morning
how was jude this morning?
i love you
how you guys are having fun
Yes. We are good I'm hoping I'll hear more from his teacher today
yeah
at least we have this email thing straight now
So this woman at the church heard my story and just gave me 100 to a spa
that's awesome
sounds like a really nice church
will you use it?
Yes
good
you don't take enough time for yourself
you deserve it
Bummer all booked for the one time I have child care
that stinks
can you drop off josh at VBS one day?
That's what I tried
oh, well what about this weekend when you parent come up
we (the whole family) may be invited to a company picnic on Aug 5th.  would we be interested?
We will just be getting back
yeah i know
we don't have to go, and we may not even be invited i just wasn't sure if there was interest
i'm sure it will be good food, nice ppl, and we will be treated well
I can't think about that right now
ok
Haven't heard from Jude's teacher but he says she told him he was much better today so...
see that's good
do you feel better?
Yes
how is josh doing
Loves VBS doing great!
cool
too bad that church doesn't have an opening
I know another one close does though
you should check it out
that is all the diocese of VA
I'm going to I think
Also an opening in Arlington And front Royal
i think i put a resume in for the church in front royal when i was in front royal
i mean in seminary
Oh really Calvary?
it was a long time ago but i'm pretty sure i put a resume into a church in front royal and it is pretty small town so i can't imagine there is more than one  episcopal church
Ok
i also looked at randolph macon when i was shopping for high schools
arlington will likely be inner city type ministry
Oh ...hmmm ok. Well I think I'm going to throw some resumes out there and see what sticks
ok
my mom told me that fairfax hs is switching all their bathrooms to unisex
No pressure or anything just see where if the spirit leads
ok
Lol
clearly they don't know what unsupervised teenage boys will do in a girls locker room
True although not sure a sign could stop them anyway
no but you don't take the fence around the hen house down just because you think the fox might have a way around
True... I agree
i mean i guess we don't have girls so whatever but i'd be livid if we did and we lived there
for most teens, however, it will likely just mean you can't use the bathroom all day
Yeah I hear that...I don't want to pee with men in the bathroom and I'm middle aged
unfortunately it will take something bad for them to reverse such a policy
in any event, sounds like you have some leads
Someone will get raped
I thought you meant Fairfax church at first I didn't realize you meant school.cou ty that's deplorable
no, yeah it's the school
fairfax county is very liberal
Yeah that's terrible
There's liberal.and then there's stupid
they also spend a boat load busing immigant kids across the county
when my mom was working for the county she was telling me that they had one kid that lived in front royal and went to school in NOVA so they had a taxi for him like 2.5 hours each way
usually its the same thing
liberal is usually code for good intentions but no foot hold in reality
Oh god
True
Love you
Love you too. It was nice to hear your voice
your parents were very sweet and invited me to a family dinner
That was nice
When is your lunch break
i tend not to take one why, you need to talk?
Just for a minute
ok one sec
i'll call
Ok
most amazing thing.  i found 2 gallon zip lock bags
that's right 2 gallon they are awesome
Lol
i bit the crap out of my cheek
ouch
Sorry
I'm.sorry could you go out with Chris for a drink
I just saw a recipe for a burger where the bun is made out of fried Mac and cheese
That sounds like just the pick-me-up you need
Bryan said that he wants another dog but not a puppy because they are too much work
i think a baby is not in his future
Lol
i was reading this article yesterday that was talking about this night club in charleston, who knew we had night clubs, that apparently was only letting white ppl in
a good and noble thing to make a stand about except that the author was apparently so upset about the situation that he couldn't control his own racism
he was making all sorts of comments about white ppl not being able to dance and other racist slants towards white ppl
kinda destroyed his credibility 
Idiot
Can you help me feel less guilty about taking Josh to the movies today
He's exhausted I'm exhausted but I feel guilty about screen time and money
it will be fine
the money and screen time is better than either or both of you getting sick because you didn't take the break
sometimes you just need to rest
i'm planning tests I'm thinking i'll take the first exam Oct 22 and the second exam Jan 6th. let me know if those dates work
Not till October for the first one?
The course comes with a study planner. I tried to use the 6 month planner and found I was rushing gand not getting stuff so this is the 9 month planner. The first test is the longest with study time at 10 weeks and then the next 2 are 8 weeks and the last one is like 4 wks
I can try the 6 month planner again the first test would be 7 weeks put
Out
I don't need to micromanage this you decide. Jan 6 is really close to Christmas.
Yes but the nts for the two section expires Jan 17th
Ok sounds good then
I'm having a day I just can't handle anymore
Josh is being very difficult. I haven't eaten a real meal in days.
I'm exhausted and confused. The thought of you in study mode again all next year is a bit debilitating
i'm sorry
i can take a break if you'd like
you should go to boston market or something for dinner
No it's ok.
it is a real meal that you don't have to cook
I can't
i went through the study planner.  i think if i study M,T,R,F, and all day Saturday i can get it done and still have the ability to take Sunday and Wednesday
why can't you
so this kid on the playground bumped his face and lost a tooth and it was super bloody and I turn around after helping them and Jude is praying for him
awww what a good kid
i think that is an important moment to keep in your head as you start to wonder if you are 'messing up"
Skype worked perfect except to get a hood angle on my face I have to hold the phone up. My arms are going yo quickly fail.
You could prop your phone up on something
i figured out why one arm itches more than the other.  it is because they have different things in the shot
one army is trees and animals and the other is molds and grasses
Oh... which itches more
they didn't tell me which is which but i think probably the dust and mold one
it is definitely true that one makes me want to tear my arm off and the other isn't too bad
they said I start the maintenance color next time and I can't get it more than once a week because it is so strong but i still have to get a shot every 10 days
there's a girl in my office that is trying to lose weight so she is giving away food
i've gotten two avocados and a whole thing of blueberries out of her
Seems strange to give away healthy food...
agreed
i tried to get her to keep it but she said she was leaving for DC next week and wouldn't eat it
i'm not one to turn away a calorie
Oh ok
True
for the last two or three weeks the main program that we do all of our work in has stopped working
on friday afternoons
Seems like fate
agreed
see, this is why i love you so much.  you just get me
So many good churches just opened in Western ma. I just wish it wasn't Western ms
sorry
which churches?
Sothwick, St Andrews Long meadow
i was just thinking of st andrews
i wonder how larry is doing these days
Yeah...bishop of ling island
yeah unless he retired
I love you
Hope you guys are having fun at the splash pad
Starting my interview in three minutes
Not at splash pad today
Everyone thinks I'm being stupid to even do it
oh i must have gotten my days confused
i don't think you are stupid to do it
more options are better and at very least it is interview experience to warm up for a better opportunity
Ok...
So I just looked up diocese pay standards for shits and giggles. Medium pay for this size parish is 97,000
careful that isn't for a rector
i'm not super surprised though because the area is pretty expensive to live in
Yeah. It's for the rector but there's no associate standards
we made that mistake for St. James
they gave us the pay scale for a rector and told us that it wasn't right
Right I know maybe low side is 77
could be
So my parents hotel had a fire last night they were up.all night
Apparently your parents can't come to Jude's horse show because it's Addison and Griffen b day party and we weren't invited even though we are close right now...
Good morning!
Now apparently my parents are being kicked out of their hotel ...
crazy
i'd say they should get their money back
the implicit contract with a hotel is that you will have a safe place to sleep.  they were not safe and they did not sleep and now they are being kicked out at least an hour before normal
I think they'll refund then it's just now I have two kids and my parents to take care of
maybe you should call your dad and suggest they scrap the trip
I already tried they said no
do you think you can be more clear with your dad about your concerns
Not really
I just still don't feel great
yeah, i wonder what that is about
It's fine
Went to bed super early still feel like crap
i'm sorry.  i know that has to make everything seem harder
since your parents are coming, lets work off the assumption it is because they think they can be helpful to you
so why don't you let them and tell them to go to the caverns without you and you take a break
Yeah ..
They just want to do lunch today that's it
well it is probably good that they got kicked out of the hotel then if they think they are going to be there by lunch
I told Maryland no
How are you feeling about it
A little sad.
I just wish I was not going back to the land of lawsuits
I know I wish things were different in the church too
Calvary hired an old white guy
God has great plans for you let's just see what this year holds
I'm not sure if that is more sad for you or for them
Ok...I'm trusting God
Josh broke out in horrible rash we are still urgent care
OMG is he ok?
Do they know what caused it?
I don't know
How are you doing
He's ok. They don't know what caused it but it's an allergic reaction to something. They are giving me meds

How are you doing?
That sorta looks like the rash from dc
I'm fine
It is but it hurts and it's everywhere
Poor kid
Yeah
You guys have had a heck of a trip
Now they are sending me to a specialist.
They are concerned
Hmmmmm weird
Has he eaten anything different
No it's not allergies it's either viral or really not good
Hence the specialist
Oh
What did the specialist say
We won't see him.till Monday. I think it's fifths disease though
I've never heard of that but it does sound exactly like what happened with Josh in dc
Yeah. I'll take him to dermatologist but I'm sure it's that
Are you ok?
Oh you know
I still can't get over your parents hotel burnt down then Josh had to go to the emergency room
Apparently the fire alarm was for carbon monoxide
I went grocery shopping and the grapes we're $6!!!
I put them back
Ain't nobody got time for no $6 grapes
Right!
Josh's rash is back with a vengeance and no one will see me
That's not good. Weren't you supposed to see the doctor today
Yes they can't get him in until.sept and the pediatrician won't see him because we don't live here
That's stupid I'd go and say the emergency room told you they hink your child may have viral meningitis and if they don't see you and your child dies you will sue
and if that doesn't work i'd go back to the emergency room and get seen again.
sucks though, i'm sorry
I finally found a doctor that is deciding if it's emergent or we can wait till we get home
health care is stupid.  if he is going to go through all the work of diagnosing why not just treat
is it really that much more work to right a perscription on a piece of paper?
I want to come home now
i would like that
my mom is going to be calling you
i think you guys got your wires crossed
she is still planning on coming as scheduled
Yeah she just called
oh
you're welcome for the heads up
lol
This has been great I'm just ready to be at home
yeah i miss you guys
i mean it is nice to be able to chill but it is lonely to only talk to Molly
and to be honest i think she is getting tired of hearing me talk
lol
Did you know finger boarding is like a thing?
that's stupid
i guess i'm not surprised
is that what josh is going to do? 
Yep
well when he goes pro he can support us
lol
which raises two questions in my head
i wonder if there are pro finger boarders and if there are you think ppl laugh at them when they say that?
Yes and yes
that's ha--- wait for it.......... larious
i couldn't be friends with someone who did that i'd just laugh at them all the time, like uncontrollable.  after a while it would just be mean
I know
and they'd be like go ahead and laugh i make $100k/yr which would make me laugh even more because how asinine
Exactly
poor guys i can see them at bars
so what do you do?
i'm a fingerboarder
and the girl just walks away
Yes
You should stop now though it's becoming mean lol
or maybe its really nerdy like fingerboard clubs
oh maybe they have shirts
or patches for their black leather jackets
You really needed to feel better about yourself huh?.
no i just can't help it
what are you guys up to today
i mean besides fingerboarding

There's a whole course huh
see it's cool when you are 5
kinda sad when you are still doing at 50
looks like he is having fun
Yeah
very cool
i keep thinking that if i keep eating these salads i'll get used to them but.... ehhhhhh
Yeah I keep thinking if I workout I lose weight but ehhhhh
i think its physiologically impossible to lose weight when you are stressed
maybe we should just throw caution to the wind and go eat cake
I basically never going to be pretty again
i don't know what you are talking about i think you are pretty now
I look like a mess
or like a mom of two small kids
I'll never not be stressed again
sorry
you know what's really good for stress relief?
nevermind
All by myself don't want to be all by myself
why are you all by yourself?
where's josh?
did you sell our child?
I was responding to your stress relief comment
after eating basically a whole loaf of banana bread i think i can say i don't like boy banana bread
oh
Lol
no i was gonna say fingerboarding
But how much do you think I could get for him
lol
he's cute
you could probably get a lot as long as you just show a photo.  if he's there in person he will probably jump on someone's face all naked and the deal would go south
True
i heard it was national milkshake day
i think the radio said that dairy queen and baskin robins both have deals
speaking of stress

Tell the boys I need their skills
my life is feeling a lot less musical since you guys went to VA
Sorry
i didn't even notice until i was listening to the sound track of the greatest show and was like they are basically just singing conversations, Jill does that
Thanks I hope that's supposed to be nice
no it is i miss it
i also noticed that you taught Jude the underwear song
he sings it from time to time
Lol yeah probably
its adorable

Josh won.

Holy crap bowling got expensive
lol
but you get to wear those cool shoes
Are we ok with money
it will be fine
i don't think anyone ever went bankrupt for playing a few rounds of bowling
I know I'm scared all the time
I love you
i love you too
I think we may head to Richmond tomorrow just to have a day away
that could be good
After we drop off jude
there is some good history stuff there
there was a union prison camp there that i think you can still see
belle isle
Ok cool
the james river runs through the city too
i think there are some places where it gets shallow enough that the boys could play
i'm pretty sure belle isle is one of those places
there's also a bunch of bars there so you know, either way
I might need to drink
see, two birds, one stone everyone's happy
Josh almost got sold today
Bowling saved him
just make sure you come back with at least one child
I will
i'll let you decide which one though
They both have their issues
Dude Perfect into tears last night because I don't know how to play Magic and he wanted you
i know, it's like voting in a presidential election
awww
tell him we will play when he gets home
Total meltdown and he said he's sick of me
that kinda stung huh
did you say you understood cause you were sick of him too
No...
he was just tired
no rational child would say they wanted me more than you
you are way more fun
Lol...I'm turning into exhausted mama
sounds like a perfect time for a movie night
I love you
How are the boys
Good tired we are all going yo bed love you
Two people have applied for St James Santee and I'm sure one is an old white man and I won't get the position now
They love you don't get in your head
And yet...
You need to stay positive. If God intends for you to be there no one will be able to stop that and 9f not he has something else planned for you
Josh and I are eating our feelings and I found a hamburger that has a buffalo wing on top because you know why I choose
bean.....
it will be ok
they loved you.  i know how hard it is to keep trying but you are a good priest.  you can't forget that
It will be okay after I eat this burger
i love you
Love you too
i hope you guys are having fun
what are y'all up to
We are still half price day at Dave n busters
nice
very fun
i got fancy bread half off at walmart for my sandwich because it was close to the expiration
what's a little mold between friends though???
Nice
I worked out so hard today it hurts my biceps to play fruit ninja
that means you did it right
😁
And stick a fork in me I'm done
did you guys have fun?
Yeah. I'm just tired I need an adult conversation that happens in the day before I'm so tired I can't speak
Good morning
Is it Friday yet
I know right
Is work busy?
Actually no
So I finished my stuff and marked it prepared but they are slow in reviewing
I know once they review they are going to kick it all back with comments and I'll be crazy busy to get it all done
That kind of stinks
Yeah and this is why things get busy
sorry i missed your call
one of my bosses was talking to me
It's ok
are you feeling better today
I'm in this weird place and also knowing the opportunities at home are slim
Can you talk
yes but not for long
i've got a call in like 10 mins
would you like me to call afterwards?
Yeah that's fine just call me later
sorry
its been a weird day here
It's no big deal.
i am so thankful that you are part of my life.  i know that it has been hard being away but it is just one more sign of what an amazing mom you are that you would go away for the whole summer to give Jude what he needs.  I am very excited that you are going to be coming home soon.
I think there isn't enough cake and ice cream in our lives
Thank you.
Your brother just invited me to Addison and Griffin's birthday party on Saturday should I go
I agree
Totally, I mean unless it will make you miserable
It will be good for the boys and you might be able to sit and talk to adults
They didn't really want us they just a Pity inviting us
Still think I should go?
yeah, i'd go.  i don't think i understand my brother's motives.  If i were pressed i would say it was more likely that my brother wants you and erica doesn't so they weavered
either way it will be an opportunity to talk to adults and let the kids play with their cousins.
hey there, how's your morning going?
You're parents are insisting I stay the night
i would say if you don't want to stay don't stay
How r u?
just say you have to get back because you have the parent teacher conference
ok
How's work going?
my boss texted me at 9pm last night to tell me she was working on my cycle
What does that mean?
i was like, i'm studying can i talk tomorrow
she's like no i just wanted you to know
i don't get her she is kinda socially awkward
no one else in my office was working at 9pm so i don't think she can be upset that i wasn't working although it does feel like a passive aggressive way of saying why aren't you working
i think things are going fine though
i have had a couple of moments recently where i was having fairly technical conversations and i was keeping up which was cool
That's great! I need to know which out to get in doing more driving than I thought I should probably do the oil change
I'm having the worst panic attacy
i worked like an hour and a half on a document and this girl went in and changed it all
and now it's wrong and she doesn't even have the decency to admit she did it
why are you having a panic attack?  is it this birthday party thing?
I'm sorry
i'm just not sure if i can put it back the way it was before
That sucks...she sounds like a wench
no normally we are very friendly but i don't know why she did that
i think she is stressed but just admit to the mistake and I'll fix it
for some reason the fact that she screwed it up and won;t admit it is what is bothering me
Ok...what kind of oil.for car
i'm pretty sure that it was Castrol  GTX Magnatec 
its a blend
so you can say any synthetic blend
Got it
we have a weird oil filter on the van though so be prepared for the oil change to be a little bit more than advertised
Can you call
i love you
I want to go home
Can't wait to have you back
You're a great mom
Thank you
Jude did great moved up to 2.1 which is firmly second grade
The fear is that bigger classes and not being so bad he's a top priority will negatively affect him
Where does Tiff live?!
i just sent you tiphs contact info with his address
i know that concern all too well
Ok...there's a hotel for 99 near there should I stay there? Any suggestions for the Jude deal?
no i wouldn't get a hotel i'd just go back.  if you stay in the dc area until 6 you should be home before 9
Ok...I don't want to blow your parents off but I don't want to.impose on tiff
the jude thing is a larger conversation but the long and the short of it is i think the information proves that we are on the right track and we will continue 
i don't think it can be called blowing someone off if the invite was last minute to stay at someone elses house
there's a site called free cpa review that has additional questions
it costs $99 per section
i think maybe they don't understand the meaning of the word free
Obviously
they say they have an additional 1200 questions just for this one section though
we'll see
I'm stupid nervous about going to tiffs
I know. I understand. Just play it by ear. If it goes poorly stay for 2hrs and go home. Of party starts at 3 that puts you home by 7
I love you, good luck
How's it going
We are good guess we are staying here
Please tell me I'm a good wife and mother cause damn I'm trying
Of course you're amazing g
I appreciate you trying with my family
Jude was up and crazy at 530. Kill me now!
This is crazy want to die
I'm sorry
Was it good to stay?
I'm old. I was getting a headache because I was having trouble seeing the words on my screen so I had to get my reading glasses
Lol we should sign you up for the old people s home
I passed 2 section tests today with over an 80%
Woohoo!!
I'm so proud of you
Good morning
Good morning
Josh says he feels like he's been away from you too long
Tell him, I agree
I was thinking I might take the boys off on Saturday once u get home and give you some time
Yes!!!
It's ok, you can take some time to think about it. I don't want you to feel pressured... LoL
I hate you!
I'm so exhausted! I need a break
they got a radio in the office
....
Ugh
i hate background noise
.noise cancelling headphones?
yeah those are expensive but I am listening to my own music and i have a play list of white noise
i've thought about getting nice headphones as i'm in them basically all day every day but i don't really want to spend the money on such a luxury
my $20 walmart specials are doing the job
My parents will get them for you for Christmas
we'll see
what are you guys up to today?
Not sure stressing about child care when I get back!
well when does school start
i don't think there is a lot of time left
I have a whole week where I you back and kids are out
I tried to find a camp but it's proving very challenging
well let me know i can take the week if you need
don't stress it will be ok
i can totally split the week with your parents i have plenty of time to make it happen
I'm going to sign the. Up for three day at PG
ok i can take the last two days no problem
My parents will take one im sure so I just need one
I'll find out today which day I need you ok?
i can take them both no problem
No no they'll want them one day
ok easy enough
Plan on taking the kids on Aug. 17 all day ok?
done
Thank you
no worries, thanks for everything you have done this summer I know it has been a very full summer for everyone
josh's appmt is cancelled
and i just put my exams on the books officially
Thanks.
Someone just emailed me on my porter down email asking me to apply the st James
Porter gaud
see, i told you they love you
We will see
Orton training is a week long but they have one the week of PG fall break so I would only have to take three days off.
I think they would jump at the idea of another OG trained teacher
You might even be able to get some sorta paid PDT
I don't they don't want peoy to think they can accommodate "those kids"
In fact they have said that they want teachers trained in gifted and talented
Yes but don't the have some sort of after school of tutoring that they offer
Yes but it's not really connected with the school.so...
Oh
Yeah but I get three personal days so
.. it's possible
Yeah, and it's another feather in your hat
But it is you doing it
Jude went to bed crying tonight he doesn't want to leave Oakland. I feel so helpless
it is a magical place
but it isn't that he is leaving forever, he'll be back next summer
Trident is still an option.
They have one spot left in second grade.
They still offer the Grant and financial aid...
well we started that process we just need to get them our most recent tax return
Do you want to do that just do we can see?
sure
I booked a tour for Jude so he can see the school
i fear that we are in the middle where we can't afford it but we don't qualify
good
We don't have to do it but I think we should get the info
agreed
Maybe ...we will see
more information is always better
Ok cool.
just let him know that we are looking at the best opportunity for him
I will
how's your day?
I burned my 🍕
😥😭
U?
yeah i'm not having a great day either
Why?
my shot doesn't itch as bad as it has though so i think that means they are working
i've been saying i need help for months and now its the last minute and they are realizing that there are things not right on some of my cycles
That's good news so what's wrong
and not only that but i have had my work marked as completed for at least 3 weeks now and they just sat there
if they would have reviewed the work 3 weeks ago there wouldn't have been a problem
i'm finding this boss very challenging.  i'm sure she feels the same about me though so whatever
I'm sorry
it will be fine
Sounds like time management is not awesome there
i think my component is not as awesome as i first thought
that is why so many ppl have been getting fired
Maybe it will get better once everyone feels more confident with the audit
Oh no!
Are you worried?
hopefully
not really
i'm basically always worried about losing my job but there is no reason to worry
but they keep looking to other components to see what they should do or how they should do it
Not me I'm a beacon of components
i'll feel better once i get my CPA
Yeah I get that.
i've gotten a 75% or better on my first 6 chapters
i really want to pass this darn thing the first time
Awesome!!
i found out yesterday that there is only a 20% chance of passing all 4 section the first time
50% pass rate on each test
that's crazy huh
Yeah
Just focus on one test of time and it'll be fine
yeah i think i have a good strategy
I'm scared all the time of money of failure of screwing up the kids. It's almost debilitating
i know what you mean
i get like that sometimes about this test
I if I let him Satan has a field day with that stuff
i have to remind myself that negative speak is counter productive and that there is a plan in place
i guess the same is true about the kids
exactly
Who knows you could be one of the 20%
i think it is possible
i heard from a couple of different places recently that the biggest determination in success is drive
drive is basically the only thing i have going for me right now. lol
bryan just said that if he had to take the test over again he would resign today
lol
Haha
I am so homesick today
you'll be back before you know it
i miss you too
It's still raining here and now the power is out
Kill me now
Good morning!....still raining
Yeah it's wet here too
I know I shouldn't be worried about one issue with your manager but I'm struggling
I get it, I find everything stressful these days
Let's just scrap everything and open a duck donuts



I'm in
Everything ok?
Yeah I'm fine e
there was a really hard concept in my studying that i totally rocked this time through
i'm going to choose to celebrate the positive things
That's good
I'm having trouble finding because I'm so worn out
i think it is amazing that they have asked you several times to apply at st james
i think it is really amazing that you have done so much for jude
i think it is really an act of God that you haven't killed Josh with as many times as he has jumped on you
i love you
i think you are doing an amazing job
Feeling a bit better had a huge headache so I took a nap
sleeping always make life better
how did you convince Josh to lay down?
Love you too
I told him I'd buy him a new part to his hot wheels track #worth it
I'll admit my parenting has gotten a little sloppy they are winning most days at this point
lol
Can you call?
yeah
My friends just cancelled for tomorrow so it's another day just me and the boys any suggestions
if it rains go to the movies if not i'd go for a hike you haven't done that since you first got there
you won't have hills for much longer
It's going to rain
They were running two hours behind!!
We are just leaving!
Good
Good morning
Morning!
How r u?;
I'm ok, I stayed up too late last night
Why?
Is 8t raining there
Getting this application together
Turns out we filled it out while I was interviewing
Oh sorry
It's ok there wasn't going to be a good time to complete it
I'm sorry
I miss you getting us out on my own is going to be hard
you want me to come up and help?
No it's ok I know you're busy the boys can help
I'm going to mess up this decision maybe we should just keep everything the same for awhile what's the worst that could happen
we aren't making any decisions right now we are just gathering information
Ok
we will get all the information and make the best choice we can with the information that we have. the important thing is that we make the decision together.  I love you, it will be ok.
Ok .. thanks
How'd the science museum go
Awesome! Now to conquer the bike rack...how was your day?

Hell yeah!
you rock
did you get the stuff in the car before you did that
Yes I'm wonder woman
i was gonna go with shera but ok
😊
Three hours just finished packing now. Crying in the shower this is hard!
just take it slow you can tell the boys you need a break
What's up
sorry i pocket dialed you
i hope i didn't wake you
It's ok I wasn't sleeping.
Good night
get some sleep you, I want you to be safe coming home to me :)
Good morning
tax free weekend starts today
Teachers say Jude is doing high level math and progressing really well in phonics
remember when i was all "these shots don't itch anymore"?
yeah that was funny
Sorry! Did you talk to boss?
yeah it was fine
she was mostly happy with me
?
Oh yeah
she said i should keep bugging her when things are ready for review until she does
That's annoying but whatever
i think the deal is that i'm just really gun shy after st james so i'm always expecting the other show to drop but when i think about it kearney has never done anything except try to build me up and be happy with my progress
yeah i agree but at least she was able to see it from both sides
That's awesome!
We are in North Carolina
It rained the whole time and there's construction and shut down and they got lost and there was no place to eat
But we are here
I'm super fried and I have the worst headache
Thank God the hotel is beautiful I think it might be brand new
that's awesome
you should take the boys to the pool and let them swim without you
Definitely eating at cheesecake factory and sipping a long island ice tea
nice, you deserve it
Yes yes I do!
Does the calendar on the fridge go thru the year?
BTW, I figured you'd be tired after driving today so I have dinner figured out for us
Thanks! My mom made Mac and cheese too.
ETA is more like 5 sorry
We are about an hour away but I'm caught in storm now
You can pull over if you need to
Be safe
My brother totally blew is off tonight. I felt bad for my mom
Should I go over there
No it's ok...I just felt bad. I feel bad about everything. I can't seem to settle back in
Give it some time I knew the transition back would be hard
how's your day going?
Oh you know. How r u?
not bad
just crunching numbers
i was thinking I should start working on my mental math skills
i wish i could have stayed home with y'all and had fun
We went to dentist and the school not so much fun really
well ok as long as you don't have any fun
lol
They hired a second receptionist so now they really don't need me to sub anymore...I'm going to be very bored 💤
that's good for you
it will help to improve your case
how are things at home?
Ok we are going to the gym
nice
i hope you have a good workout
Thanks
Do you need me to go to the grocery store today? Lisa brought over cinnamon rolls as your bread tomorrow. Can it wait one more day or no?
yeah totally
Ok.
don't worry about me there is a grocery store like 3 minutes away from the office if i really need something
Ok
hey btw, there is a girl in my office that is getting married.  I feel like I should go  its the sunday of labor day
Ok
i got an email from the chaplains
What do you mean?
the new contact at the anglican chap for the armed forces emailed me asking for a status update
i find the whole situation very conflicting
I can't talk.rifht now I'm crying I can't stop I'm having the worst panic attack
do you need me to call?
i can call you and we can talk it through
Josh got the shitty teacher it just threw me over the edge
you mean he got Judes teacher from last year?
No he got one that's even worse
oh
Yeah
can we request a different teacher
No
hmmmm
maybe we can go with your first idea of saying we aren't doing your homework we have our own stuff we will work on with them
that does suck though
i could teach math if you do reading
That's ridiculous
He's not going to school all day so we can teach at home
it is kinda stupid but it happened last year
i'm sorry
I'm headed home now
Ok us too!
I'm still kinda a mess will you sleep with me tonight
Yes
I'm sorry if is so bad
It's fine I just feel trapped
I just got my carpool switched to Wednesday.
That definitely helps!
i'm glad that worked out
i'm with the boys on the 17th right?
What day is that
next friday
Does the shared calendar say I have a show
you have a show on saturday 18 and friday the 24
Then know why would I need you on Friday
i thought you had to go back to school on the 17th but the boys didn't go back until the following week
Oh yes
for some reason i started to get my schedule mixed up in my head and i was thinking you went back this friday so i just wanted to confirm it was next friday
Yes next Friday
i got a shot today and I asked about the redness, she said that is normal and then asked if it hurts because that is also normal
Lol lucky you
yeah
still worth it to make it through the year without getting sick
i have been wondering lately though, if we move to another place in the country will i have to start over on these shots
Yeah
have you guys done anything fun today?
We went to beach this morning now I'm trying to rest
that sounds fun
Lisa got stung by a jelly fish
did she have to go to the hospital?
No she was like owe my leg really hurts we stayed in the water ten minutes more then I saw the jelly fish it was crazy.
she didn't think to touch her leg when it hurt?
I dragged all the kids out they became jelly fish hypochondriacs I couldn't stop laughing
Lol
I don't know
I'm headed home
Thank you for all your hard work


beautiful
This was a mistake
in a hot and sweaty kinda way
that looks like hard work
Jill,

I am writing to express to you the difference your serving at St. James parish this summer made in our lives and our walk with Jesus. My husband (Bill) and I moved to McClellanville in 2000 and attended St. James until the 2008/2009 time frame. We loved being a member of a local church; unfortunately we began to feel that we needed to be fed more spiritually and sought out another church home – we’ve been driving to Mt. Pleasant now for many years – at the Mt. Pleasant church our spiritual needs were fulfilled but we missed the community connection that we had while attending St. James.

When we heard that a change was coming to St. James we immediately engaged and prayed; hoping our spiritual needs could be fulfilled right here in our wonderful home Village. God brought you to us for several amazing sermons – you have definitely been given a gift from God to embrace His word and to inspire others with them – I don’t know if you realize how gifted you are – often the gifts given to us by God come so easily that we don’t understand how amazing they are and what we can to with them – please know you have a gift.

Your sermons made such a difference in both of our lives – for the first time Bill would, throughout the week, refer to your sermon and pull from it meaning and guidance into what we were facing at that moment – your sermons inspired us to grow in our walk with Jesus; I can’t thank you enough for this!

Since your departure from St. James we have prayed that God would bring us a permanent presence such as yourself. I don’t know if it’s a possibility for you to serve St. James on a permanent basis but I pray that if it is God will guide you to do so.

It would have been easy to not take the time to write this letter to you – as humans we sometimes don’t take the time to compliment as much as we should. I have had discussions with the majority of the parishioners at St. James and they all share the same love of you as Bill and me. The attendance levels during your time at St. James were notably elevated – I know this made God smile! Bill spoke with George Geer who is on the search committee. Bill wanted to make sure the search committee would be open to expanding the pay options for the position if this helped to attract someone like you – the increase in attendance which was obvious will definitely result in greater collections – George assured us they would be open to considering pay needs.

Thanks for your service and I pray for Gods work in your life to best utilize the talents he has entrusted you with!


With immense thanks and gratitude,

Eileen and Bill Wallace



what a wonderful email
you must feel pretty good about that
It's pretty nice
I wonder what God is doing with me right now
i mean i already knew all that stuff to be true about you
If I send you this email I have to print out from PG can you do that for me
yes
Sent it to Andrew. Dwms Gmail. Just print the attached contract
also I lost my van keys I can't find them anywhere and have to take the black car to Jude's interview any idea where they might be
hmmmm
no, are you sure they aren't in your purse
or the basic would be my other guess but i didn't see them in there this morning
No they weren't either of those places
maybe you switched purses?
oh, how about the pool bag
I'll keep looking thanks
i really am very proud of you.  you are quite an amazing priest.
did you just send me a picture of jude?
Yes
is that a truck stop?
are you running away?
Moes
nice
he is a cute kid
He's in his trident interview outfit
ahhhh
I'm going to get your ice cream but I might need to go back out or I will get all soaked
I'm really hoping you're not on your motorcycle In This Storm
I could really use a girls night tonight is there anyway you could come home so I can go out with Lisa
If not I understand
yes
i am going to get off early today.  i was going to stay here and study but i can go home and study in the playroom until you're ready to go.
Ok
bryan's wearing jeans and flip flops

There's no place to paint or cover it
there is not much you can do with the open network stand but the three boxes you could make into one of those minecraft ppl
Oh yeah that's cute is my brain going to fry from the open network power
no
i don't think such a small setup would use very much power at all
it is no different than having a computer plugged in there
you could make it a minecraft priest
!!!!
that's so much fun
Don't worry about coming home early I'm exhausted I can't go out tonight
what if i come home early and you go to a coffee shop by yourself while i put the kids to bed?
I'm on for a double at black fedora tomorrow so I feel bad making you do it two nights in a row
i'm going to study all day tomorrow
i'll welcome the break
you go we'll be fine
Do you know where the remote is?
Going to see if she'll I'll be home later love you
A show*
Ok we're good hope you enjoy
Sorry you had to take the van
adding on to our conversation from last night title 25 of the US code is entitled "Indians"
there's a girl in my office that is wearing a calf length sweater and this guy asked her if she was wearing a bathrobe
Lol...
they just blocked my amazon music
Sorry
its ok. i signed up for google
lol
i love you.  hope you're having a good day.
You too. I'm good. Tired!!
good meetings?
Interesting topics... Maybe a little much to explore the day before students arrive
People were really stressed
yeah
The kids are going to my mom's tonight I think I'm going to do a light workout and go to a movie
i think it was good that you are starting to noticed the difference between the normal beginning of the year stress and what is unusual
you should
that sounds fun!
Are you in your movie yet?
No I'm not going what's up
Everyone's going out to eat I'll be home afterwards
Ok I'm.going to bed. I'm stressed. I miss you
Good luck bean. I know you are going to be great because you are the best teacher at that school. My prayer for this year is that with a year under everyone's belt your ministry will grow even more and you will become a voice of wisdom and change in that place
Thanks! Love you
ppl in my office are talking about 'old' ppl who are actually 54
Oh god
they were like "well maybe not hold but too old to be out playing tennis"
old*
Lol
how's the first day?
this person is putting the same amount in their retirement 13.7% as i get in my paycheck
its nice to be a doctor
There's a financial planning thing for the Episcopal Church that I get for free on September 16th do you want to go
i'm sure it will be geared towards the CPG
So no?
it could be interesting in learning about your retirement but i don't think it will be helpful
i think it will be the CPG telling everyone how great they are
have you heard anything?
Okay well I don't think I can go it's a little too crazy for me so we'll just skip it
i can go and report back if you would like the info or if you think there might be a concern with your pension
What time do you think you'll be home tonight?
8ish unless you need me sooner
No that's fine
Thank you for picking up the medicine. I still have to get boys to bed feed Molly fold laundry and come up with dinner. I appreciate the help
don't worry about mollly or the laundry i can do both when i get home
i'll pick up buns for the hamburgers on my way home too
I did Molly im on the laundry
I think we have hamburger buns
so stop doing the laundry and let me do that hwnei get home
Working full time is really hard. It is so tough to keep up with everything im always overwhelmed
i can tell you are overwhelmed that's why i'm asking you to let me help

Bare naked banana bread making
Already got in trouble with Charles today. Everything is awesome!!!
Yeah but Charles opinion matters less and less
I love you
I'm having g the boys take a nap since you'll be out late tonight
Ok
It is really hard working with Charles. Just really hard. I have to have such a thick skin it's exhausting
i'm sure
it is just important to remember that what he says is probably not well thought out, situationally aware, pastoral, or probably even correct and it certainly doesn't carry half the authority that he wants you to believe
Exactly
remember that ministry is about relationships over the long term and you are doing everything right to have a major impact on that school and those families
the rest of it is just noise
Can you please say a prayer for me I am having really bad panic attacks this morning and it just sucks
i'm sorry
i knpow all this school stuff is hard
Shoot my shows it 5 so we will be home at 3 I have to leave at 330 that's not much study time im sorry im a screw up
is ok i've reviewed 4 chapters already and i will study more after the kids go to bed
I could take them to the show we are out at 28
What's better for you?
no it's ok bring them back @ 3
i'll be fine
i've got tonight and tomorrow to do my thing
Thank you I was missing being there
Did everyone get off without any tears
Jude was a little sad that you were gone when he first woke up but got over it fast. Josh was sad that he had to wake up at all
Josh has also started a thing where he doesn't want pictures and he didn't want me to come in because I might embarrass him??? If course I was even more over the top because of it
Lol
I just got my shot.t he woman wiped my arm with alcohol, gave me the shot, then put cream on. The only problem was none of those things happened in the same spot
On both arms! LoL
Oh God
Im worried about the kids hope today goes well
It will be fine the have nice teachers
how you doing?
Im good. I promised I'd take the boys to ice cream where did you go the other day
baskin robbins
get the ice cream in cups.  the ice cream melted faster than i've ever seen before
Hope you have a great day. I miss you already
Are you there already?
I'm here in just got off the Metro I'm getting ready to walk into my office now
I miss you this is hard
My fob doesn't work on the door
I miss you im lonely
I miss you too
i really enjoyed our phone call this morning
i think it was the best part of my whole day so far
your chapel is going to rock don't worry
there's a black dude here that just said all those latina girls look the same to him
lol
Lol
I feel that way about blond boys at PG
Chapel went awesome reminded me why I am here
lol
i knew it would
seriously had no doubt at all
Thank you
I love you
You too
i've noticed that my eyes hurt when i look at my screen without my reading glasses
Because you're old lol
this girl in my office almost tried to guess my age and i'm pretty sure she was about to say 50
lol
Oh no!
she held her tongue at the last minute but i could swear i heard fi- come out
my manager is like, we are going out think of where you want to eat but i really want to eat somewhere cheap
Lol me too me too me too
i'm like yeah we should totally sit down and talk... at chik fil a
Im starving stop talking about Chic filet
me too
i skipped breakfast because there isn't a free breakfast at the hotel
Bummer
so i got lunch for free
Where?
there was this nice little mexican restaurant downstairs that just started last week
everyone wanted to try it so we went
i was eating and this waiter came by with a full tray of hot sizzling fajitas and whatnot
and all the sudden he dropped it right where i was sitting
Oh no are you burned
no
i'm fast
i saw it tipping and i slid all the way over in the both
i think i smashed my sr manager against the window and moved the whole booth trying to get away but it mostly missed me
Is that why you got free lunch
yes
but that means i've spent $20 on food plus dinner tonight
did you hear this is the last big bang?
I know bummer
apparently Jim was ready to go
When do you think you'll be home?
as of right now my flight is on time so i should be home around 9ish
Ok cool
do you need me to do something?
No
Just wondering
if i'm home by 9 maybe we can watch a show or something
Sounds good
I'm on the plane coming home
Wow that's early right
No, the closet the doors 10 mins early and the flight takes off @630
Ok
Did you feed Molly
No
I don't think I can come home
You can take your time we picked up a bit and now we are playing this farkle game
Ok
I'm sorry I'm not more help
It's thundering park is closed shoot me
You coming home?
No..we are going to wait it out a bit.
Maybe im just choosing an anxiety outlook or leaning into negativity. But im so overwhelmed and exhausted
Well three kids is a lot
Im just A terrible person
No, you aren't. you just trying too hard
No one can be all things to all ppl
i think you are amazing. you are a great mom, a wonderful wife, an amazing priest, and my best friend.  i'm so happy to have you in my life
we should move to the greek islands when we retire
I could dig that
just lay on a beach and enjoy life
I like it. No kids
exactly
what was the little island that we were on
Mykonos
yes that one
there were little shops and white beaches and we could eat out every meal
I miss just me and you
me too
i love having kids and wouldn't trade it for anything but sometimes i  do get jealous of everyone in my office without kids
they are in kickball leagues and they go out drinking with friends on a whim or somewhere for the weekend
Just had to stay with nervous Jude while his teeth came out bring home eine
Wine
lol
you should have let me take him
I know
Im a freaking mess
i need to pick up some salad stuff so i'll get wine too
poor bean
No no don't really im.fine
I do need gold spray paint of you can pick that up
yeah
Thank you
how's jude doing?
Ok he won't eat though. Josh doesn't want to come home do he's staying there
At Grandma's
Cause I suck at parenting
no you don't he wants to stay at your parent's because they give him no rules
it's like a giant play land
Im awful St everything
no you aren't
i'm sure if i came home right now jude would prefer you to me
I don't like him being away from me
josh?
it's ok, i imagine you have your hands full right now with jude
Yeah. It's fine im just emotional haven't heard from mccleanvillev

Which would you rather?
Bright
On the right
Not glitter huh?
It's for the ark of the Covenant
I don't know where you're gonna find acacia wood
This time good said use cardboard boxes so...
I always knew God was green
Take care of creation o have to paint it tonight so it's dry for the car ride tomoy
Heard from.santee they are making me preach again I kinda want to drop out
Tha5 seems silly, you prea preached there for over a month
It's cause they are interviewing both of is they are also making us preach the same passage
I guess that makes sense.
Im crying this isn't working I think I want to bail
I get that. It 8s hard when you know they are judging you. Maybe you are looking this wrong though
Maybe they are judging the dude against you
did you know you could get a bone transplant?
The bubble machine is ready for pick up will definitely fit in motorcyy I sent you the email verification thanks so much
Walmart Pickup: Your order 5111891392489 is ready for pickup from 8a-8p daily until 09/04. Reply HELP for help; STOP to stop

It's in the office 9f the middle school maybe? Your schools too big and everything locked so I couldn't figure it out sorry
Thank you
You even remembered batteries... I don't think I've ever loved you more than right now
i'm reading a contract for a medical trial which has to explicitly forbid the recipent of the grant from human trafficking
you think that's a thing that happens in the medical community?
Maybe with people getting paid to test a drug
Chapel was so great today and I had a great meeting with Julie too
Woot woot
that's wonderful
i'm glad your day went well today!
how did eucharist go?
Good and it gave me a chance to flush out my sermin for the interview. How was josh this morning? You doing ok?
he was fine
we had fun playing a game of kalla
then i dropped him off today
its a bit of a bummer that i don't get to see them very much
Yeah im sorry how's the studying
we'll see i guess
i'm starting to skip around a bit
Ok...
Do you have to study all three days this weekend?
i don't entirely know how this weekend is going to play out
i need to study and i have a funeral and a wedding
i'm just going to the service not the reception for both
i would like to get some family time in though
Funeral?
yeah for the guy's mom
Oh... wedding?
a girl at work is getting married
Right when r those things
the wedding is going to be at charlestown landing if you guys want to come we can do the wedding and then go around with the kids
funeral is sat @3pm
wedding is sunday @4
what were your plans
did you want to go out with lisa this weekend
I think Saturday im going to take kids to the water park for the day. Sunday my parents for a cookout and at some point I want to finish the front yard
I have a show tomorrow night
yeah i see that on the calendar
i'll be home early tomorrow
Ok. I love you.
i'm sorry i'm so absent
i wish i could learn faster
Don't let your confidence slip...we love you and that you are thinking about our future and providing for our family

Maybe we could split the day on Monday so we both get a break and "connect" in the middle of the day
that sounds good
what do you remember about our wedding day?
do you remember signing the paper?
i totally don't
Why? Are you trying to get out of something?
no we were talking about this girl getting married
i was like i don't remember much
i remember being hungry and bits and pieces of the day
they were saying that most weddings ceremonies are only 10 minutes including processional and recessional
Wow! I know ours was longer than that. I remember being annoyed by all the picture taking
i didn't remember that
I think we did sign the paper we were having our picture taken in the hallway in front of a window and someone came over and had us sign in
Say a prayer for me as I navigate to spelling list this week
i remember being annoyed with our bride's maids and groom's men
with jude?
One for each kid spelling test tomorrow
spelling just sucks
Josh cried but Jude nailed it. I have a stomach thing so we are going to chill the rest of the night
you want me to come home 
you can go to bed and i'll do the kid thing
It's ok im good
i don't want to wear yourself out
It's ok. Kids are tired too. I just made dinner now we're going to chill
ok
I'm probably going to go to bed with them though
Ok, I hope you feel better
Elizabeth just reached out to me
Elizabeth who?
Dulaney from FFF
Why?
She apparently still doesn't have a church and I think she got the official word she has hunting tons. She wants a name for a counselor
Oh bummer
Did you know Finn has leukemia
I feel bad for her
No I didn't hear that
Sad
Yeah Amy posted on Facebook
Did they reach out to you
Oh
so your boss goes to you and says i need you to pull some information for the auditors.  You notice that you have the option of pulling summary versions or full detail version.  Which one would you think the auditors might want?
Full version
i don't feel like this is rocket science
they continue to send us summary versions and then they are like... "oh we didn't know you wouldn't want the summary version you never said that"
I have this office chair from our house in my office and eventually soonish I'm going to need it out. Do you want me to bring it home or offer it to people here
well i never told you to put pants on before coming to work but you knew to do that
Lol
if you bring it home we can put it at the table in the play room
what's lisa doing this weekend?
Ok...I don't know
you guys should go out one night
We will see show nights are exhausting I know I won't want to go out on Saturday
ok
i'll try to get the kids to let you sleep in tomorrow
Thank you
did you realize that Amanda's second child is a year old?
I know
crazy
What time do you think you'll be home
around 5
Ok see you then
Ur in judes room tonight lock the door
Just leaving the theater at 11 and Darrell totally yelled at me tonight
I think I could be fat and happy lol
How's it going?
just finish this funeral now
Oh right I forgot about that
How was it
Good
I think he was happy I went
I was doing questions on my phone
That's good
Are you guys having fun?
You are a terrible person lol
Yes but I went on a roller-coaster and twice and now I'm so sick to my stomach
I paid attention for the prayers, but it was Presbyterian so there weren't very many of those
Heading indoor virtual one at WonderWorks
You are so old
I know right
The funeral got me thinking about the celebration of life terminology at funerals
Do you think us trying to make a celebration out of a funeral Robbs people the opportunity to mourn?
Why
I think it's something we hold in tension a good preacher can make that happen
It kind of felt like everyone wanted to chance to cry but the implicit message was you're not supposed to cry here
Just the liturgy or preaching too?
I'm do exhausted my body is rebelling
I hear that you guys should start heading back
Well, it was Presbyterian so there wasn't really any preaching
The pastor just summed up. I'm not sure he referenced the reading and there wasn't really an invitation to accept. His whole sermon was we have faith because it will comfort us when we face death
I think anglicans do a better job
It's not his fault he's a doctor, which is almost synonymous with bad preaching
I think the service, esp the earlier services give the opportunity to mourn. A loss and hope in the future with christ
How are you holding up
I love you
I love you too how is the wedding
it was nice very similar to ours
it was an AME service
Hmm
I had to take 3 Advil but I can walk now
aww why
from the yard work?
I don't know sometimes that old injury from Jude just acts up
hmmm 
that's not good
Yeah it's a real bummer
awesome news
the big wigs are going to be swinging by and will be taking us out next wednesday.  you're invited
Cool
and i think it is restaurant week next week which will make our first time participating
you want to go right?
they are asking for an RSVP
I think I probably need to yo right
no you don't need to go but i thought you might like to go
it will be a fun night out for free
I can go I just know it will be a late night and then you'll have to study extra not sure how to do it all
i'm sorry
you don't have to go if you'd rather not
It's fine I'll go
I'm just pissed Charles just shot down my flyer and is once again got to prove he's the man in charge
you don't have black fadora until that saturday
A whole lot of work for nothing
what flyer?
Oh wait what night?
Yeah ok.
12th
Ok
I'm really struggling today
i'm sorry, i'll pray for you
what did charles want?
Going in now
It was fine. I'm just annoyed that they continue to leave me out of stuff
it does sound frustrating
I'm good chapel time and I love chapel
yeah you are a good priest
we have reservations at oak steakhouse at 6:15 next wednesday.  I understand if you don't want to go
Actually that sounds pretty early I think it'll work at
it will possible go to 9 or 930
you can certainly peace out whenever and i can uber back
Jude's sick he's coming home now
Stomach bug
aww poor guy
do i need to stay home with him tomorrow?
Yeah
Not sure maybe we can split the day
no it makes more sense for me to stay home with him, i can just work from home or take one of my bajillion sick days
Ok
how did eucharist go this morning?
Ok
who preached?
Charles
oh, did he tell anyone to slit their wrist or anything
Lol no but he did try to memorize and completely stumbled and forgot
i'd still give him a koodos for trying
the thing is the type of preaching he doesn't isn't meant to be memorized
Yeah...then dubose told me that he wants us to start doing more personal invitations to chapel but he only told me so...
what do you mean personal invites?
like guest preachers?
No like to teachers to come
hmmm
its an interesting insight into what he's hope for the department might be in any event
Yeah
I guess that's what Brian did
at a school like PG faith and politics are going to get intertwined.  if he isn't willing to make a stand the faith part of the school is only going to get but so big
Yeah
The LGBT Pride group on campus purchase stickers for teachers who want to declare their room quote safe and I was so confused because all of Campus should be safe. he basically came out and told me he students don't feel safe with Charles
i don't even know what to do with that
I know.
I I mean I get it but also all students should be safe talking to chaplains
Yes and chaplians should like ppl
There was another accident on bees ferry
I literally just got here
I want to cry 2 hours in the car
And I keep thinking about the weekend and how I'm going to entertain the kids all by myself I just I don't know
why don't i take them sunday and you can go do something without kids
maybe you and lisa can go catch a movie or something
charleston stage is doing mama mia
Yeah it's so expensive
you need a break
if you want to go you should
No it's ok I'll figure out something
I'm just panicky from being in the car
i get that
I have to give money to the Cyclone fund every year. Last year we gave a lot of money we basically tithed. I'm giving $20 this year. Until we know what's going on with the rest of our lives. Sound good?
great
i'm glad we are married.  you are amazing.
I love you too
I love you thank you for listening to me
Man stores all sold out of gas tanks so I bought one on Amazon. It will come next week
Ok
Headed home now
This family has 6 kids, count your blessings....
What family where r u?
We are picking up snacks at sonic
Oh ok I'm.supposed to be at my mom's soon
Yeah we'll be home really soon
If you aren't there I'll drop them off
I'll be here
Be home in 5
bryan said that we will almost certainly be teleworking on thursday and friday if not completely closed
dinner is officially canceled
Freaking Bryce got a job he's leaving in January
that will help you
if you get the church you should make your ask right away while you have then between a rock and a hard place
How come he gets handed a job and u have to beg
the episcopal church is an old boys club, smoking cigars with important ppl makes a difference
are you out of school tomorrow?
I don't know yet
They meet at 345 today
Definitely thinking Florida sounds fun though
I need some fun
The gov is on the TV right now the evacuate starts tomorrow at noon
All schools will be closed
I'm teleworking
Can you call me please
Okay call me
The town and suites is pet friendly
It's $125 a night
Marriott hotel
Are you there
Me: let's go watch some TV
Josh: I wanna read
Thank God
I got the time wrong it's at 1130
Ok at driving school
Where are you guys
By driving
They're changing our sheets now
Thank you
I called my mom this morning and she was crying do you think you could call my dad checking on Molly and him
We will be back by five that ok?
How r u feeling about tonight?
i'm ok
yeh we can go out
you guys have fun?
We did
Do you want me to pick up dinner on the way home
if you guys want to come back and chill you can although i wouldn't mind getting out if you don't have a preference
Ok we'll come back and we can decide where to go from there
thought you would appreciate this quite from Mr. Rogers, " Play is often talked about as if it were a relief from serious learning. But for children play is serious learning. Play is really the work of childhood."
Ive heard this but yes.
Today got crazu cause i ended up subbing
Im exhausted. Im scared about money and im nervous for my interview
Im a mess
i know you have a lot going on right now but just take it one step at a time
i'll be home a little early hopefully so maybe we can chill together and just take it easy before you have to go to BF
I need to get a suit jacket to wear to this interview
oh yeah, you told me that, sorry
Its ok im sorry im never around for you
i don't think that's true.  i think the truth is the other way around.  12 hour days 6-7 days a week don't leave a lot of time for family bonding
I was really trying yesterday to show we are supporting you not sure that came thru though
no i know you are supporting me
i am sorry, i know it must be very hard on you.  the family is held up by this test and there is really nothing you can do to make me pass faster
Bought cutest jacket 120 dollars got it for 40
I wish i was home. I miss you!
I miss you too
Daryl just asked if i want to do thr Christmas show
So if I get an 80 on a quiz but didn't think any of the answers were right does that count as a success?
Absolutely gift from heaven
I'm so proud of you for going on this interview you are in my prayers
Im feeling so sick to my stomach. I think im hungry but i cant eat.
You'll be great, ppl love you and God is leading you to his preferred future
Yeah. Im just exhausted
Just be receptive to his leading and it will he ok
All this trying
Putting myself out there
Did you not sleep again last night
I know, but you are very brave
I did im just so full tilt all the time i need some down time
i hear that
once November gets here we can all breath a little bit
scratch the race, it is the sunday you get back
Get back from...
NAES
it's all good i'd rather spend the time with you and the family after you've been gone
Oh yeah i get bavk saturday but ill want to be with rhe kids
Oh youre not going eithee
yeah i think i might miss you or something
and I think i'll likely be traveling the week before so we won't have seen each other for a couple of weeks
Ok then yes please
No need to rush home kids with my parents till 730
your dad and i texted.  he said they would get them home after dinner
Ok
so i'll go straight home and study until they show up
Ok sounds good
I have to leave at 545 im.going to trt and nap
good idea
Ps i returned that stuff today
did you see i had the return labels on the piano
i was gonna ask you about them last night but you didn't seem up to thinking about that
No i printed ar work
Its ok
I was nt im still feeling a little down but i think its just exhaustion from everything
How r the boys
I miss you all and show started late wont be home till 11
They are asleep
Ok 😥
Sorry to hear that, you can sleep upstairs
I feel very distant from you. Do you still want to be with me?
Yes I love you more than ever
I got the job!
that's great!
i'm so proud of you!!!!
how are you feeling?
Good
what do you think you want to do?
I think i want to take it. Its more money and more freedom away from.charles
totally.  I think you will enjoy being a parish priest, and I think it will make you feel like you have more options when we leave
i really am very proud of you.  that has brightened my whole day
Two questions 1. Can you get kids off bus tomorrow? Would you like to take them ro gymnastics? 2. Woyld it be easier if i take kids overnight to columbia so you can have the spave to focus for Monday?
i can get the kids off the bus and you don't need to leave i can study in the office all weekend
Ok
I love you. Sorry I'm so slammed right now.
No its ok im good
Do you want to take them to gymnastics or no?
its probably not a good idea.  i mean i'd love to and i want to go at some point but 2 days before my test is probably not that time
Ok.
Ok...let me figure tbat out then
wait
when is gymnastics
400 on friday
and when will you be getting home
Make up day but i have to work till 315
So i cant take them
But its a make up they dint have to go
oh, i thought you were asking if i wanted to take them you were asking if i could take them
yes i can take them if you won't be home
Or i can ask my parents i have a show that night too so...
it's ok i'll take them.  i will have studied all day and i can get them to bed by 7 so i can study an additional 2-3 hours
Ok cool then we will ask nothing of you the rest of the weekend
i'm sorry i'm kinda useless right now
i'll be more helpful come november
they are still not sure if they want me to travel or not
Its finr i promise
my managers can't make a decision
What week again?
who knows
everyone that has been tapped so far is going wednesday to wednesday
Ok. Next week?
it won't be next week
Oh ok. Im.confused
if i travel it will be for a week somewhere between the 15th and the 7th
Ok. Whatever ill woek it out just let me know when u can

That would be fun

When will you be home
um around 5ish i think
they are paying for lunch for me
Nice
Should i still make a big dinnee then?

in which case it would be very creative
I wrote above i need you to say how impressed you are with my sheep hat and horse what
Hat
i do think it is creative and i am impressed because i wouldn't have any idea how to make a horse costume
Did you see tje sheep thats impressive
i only got one picture
oh never mind there were two, the sheep is cute
that's gonna be adorable
Right!?!
where did you get black cotton balls?
Michaels

Im getting good at this job

i love you
Love you too
i'm pretty sure one of my sr associates came in high
his eyes are all red and puffy
Oh god.
People suck
Its bad that i really just want the kids to stay at school today forever
no you've been all out for a while i can understand that you are tired and need a break
even though it seems like we never see each other i really love spending time with you.  i miss you
did you find out what the deal was with the student?
Not a student a teacher has breast cancer

Thats good. Do you think i should message and ask for last years price its hone up $500
yeah, worth asking.  the worst they will do is say no
Ok
I'm. Coming home
Yay!!
Getting ready to take off on time
what are you guys doing today?
Not sure
Do you know what time youll be home?
I didnt make a plan for today because i didnt know what was happening we are winging it
no, i just hit 58 hours and i asked again and they said don't worry about the hours just get the work done
i'm sure i can be home by 4:30 or 5 if you want to go out
i just found out that i'm working tomorrow
:(
Ok. Do you have an eta for today?
i'm thinking i've got an hr left in me and then i'll be home if you want to make plans with lisa.
will that work for you?
Sure
i can come home sooner if you have plans or are trying to catch a movie or something
No, that's fine
Bavk row on the right
Found a really cool new park
which park?
Lenavar
where is that?
West ashlet near hometeam bbq
Hows work?
ok
i'm having to redo work
this manager merged a replica so my work ended up getting lost
and then i redid it and they were like I want it different than the other manager so i am redoing it a third time
whatever though i get paid by the hour
Oh that sucks
on the bright side though, i came up with the brilliant idea to put peppermint creamer in my hot chocolate
A.... wait for it..... MAZING
Totally
did you make this lasagna
No
who made it?
My mom
reallly?
Yes
amazing.  it is possible one of the best lasagnas i've ever had
Ill tell her
please do
I'm off
Cool. I made taco pie at home or theres a hugr salad or pizza your choice
Should I go to your parents for birthday stuff
No next Friday
K
I love you!
Love you too, sorry I've been all out lately
Its ok. Im proud of how hard you are workinv im just falling apart and i dont know who else to ask for help.
we will get you some help
how's your day been?
Over whelming
why has this grandma dying thing become a bigger issue?
No intrinsic stuff thats just making me think and work too hard
oh
actually using it or the teacher's fighting it
Both
yeah you are amazing, i don't know i have the patience
I love it but my head is spinning right now
when i was reading the intrinsic discipline book i did find it an intriguing idea that adults don't stop throwing temper tantrums we just disguise it better
True
sounds like your teacher's might be having some temper tantrums about using this method
Lol
Yes but Julie is so supportive if a little clueless
hey i have a question
Whats up
can i convince you to go to this event with me on November 11th when you get back
it is designed to be fun and i think it could be good for you to be a little careless
plus its a sunday so your parents are already planning on having the kids
What is it
its a horse race
in hollywood
or however you spell it
you can meet some of my work friends and the whole thing is catered and free
plus its a good excuse to get dressed up
i don't want to force you but i think it could be fun and i think you don't get a lot of that
Ok.
ok i'll add you.  I do think you will enjoy yourself.
Ok
So i have to go to another school function tonight to pray. Ahhhh
at what time
i need to be home by 530 again?
No i can bring the kids
you sure?
i want you to be able to do your job
Its a volleyball tournament they can come
ok
i think it is significant that they keep asking you to do these upper school prayers
Yea pay me like a head chaplain and i wouldn't complain
lol
I think there will be a time when you can bring that up
in the meantime it gives you the influence to make some significant impacts into the community
True
it also makes you a defacto department head even if you don't have the title
No
I just mean i think your oppinion will carrry more weight than charles'
I love you.  Praying that your internet isn't down today.
my managers do this thing where they give me the least amount of information possible to answer my question.  it is really annoying
That is annoying
Sorry my Bluetooth was on

So cute right
very cute, i love it
Love you. Sorry i didn't get to say goodbye
Love you too. Hope chapel went well
Im hiding in the bathroom in a huge panic attack because charles is watching my class
maybe he'll learn a thing or two
i think he isn't allowed to say anything bad and he wouldn't have any reason to because you are a great teacher
although fi you don't want him to say anything maybe you should just show the kids spiderman
Well that sucked 😥
i'm sorry, you need to talk?
I habe more class and then to run home to our kids because rhey had a half day
you want me to get them today so you can have a minute?
I have parent teaxher conferences where i will hear jude is behind im tires
No its ok i know youre busy
i'm not too busy for you
Ill be ok i have a half hour to zone out rigjt now
Can you call me
can i call you after i get off the phone or do you need me immediately?
No whenever
what do you need to talk about?
This weekend and im just sad
BTW, i grabbed Josh's card.  he left it on the table this morning.  I'll bring it to the restaurant tonight
How's the fair food?
Amazing
But we all got sick on this endless turning ride lol
as it should be
So i just got an email that coastal christian school has just syarted a new program called grace that is for dyslexic children
yeah?  does it look good?
I think so
I love the idea of it being christian too
I bet they'd give us a price break
In fact says on website christian ministers get a disvount and its 7000 a year per child not terrible
Yeah that's good
Is it after school?
No i mean its a full day real.school where i think they do og pull out program called grace
Whole thing 7000
Oh that might be something worth taking a tour
Yeah
What time do you think yol be home?
I'm trying to leave now
I'm finally out headed home now
i'm about to put in this time off request.  its the 1-2 of november right?
No 8 and 9 just to pick boys up
I just talked to Bryan and he said he'd let me know if he wants me to take time off for it or not but he seemed fine
That's good
so fun facts
i made an extra thousand dollars on my paycheck that I got this past friday
and i have over 70 hours of sick time so if you need me to do these doctor/dentist appt with the boys please let me
actually disclaimer, i made an extra thousand dollars we only saw 600 of it though... damn taxes
Yeah the tax thing is killing me get some good freaking schools then tax me ass munch
Yeah i said it
lol
i was actually just thinking that.  I wouldn't resent the taxes so much if the services we are paying for didn't suck to bad
so bad*
I tjought you were getting the kuds at 630 ish
I texted your dad to ask if he was going to drop them off or if he wanted me to get them and radio silence

I can go now though
That would be great
R u still at work?
Everything good?
I could really use a check in im juat having a day
Oh no! I'm sorry why
Your thing not going well?
Its ok just tell me you love me
Lots and lots cuz you're the bestest
I think you're a great priest

Dec
i'm about to move my test date from Dec 3 to Jan and i was trying to decide if there was any different for us if i chose 7 or 14

i know we need to replace the altima but i love the low property taxes
Lol
So tbere2 is a school on bees ferry similiar to coastal christian they have a wecond grade and allow og pull out but i have to find the tutor
could you be the tutor or would that be too crazy?
I couldnt bevause of my work schedule
i thought that was probably the case
is the other school a christian school?
Yes small 6000 a year
is it the one associated with our church?
No different school
But truthfully im thinking we just hire a tutor three days a week two week days one weekend
i don't know that i have a strong leaning right now.
i should be home by 5:30 or 6 depending on traffic
So im not even lying the projector light went out 5 minutes before chapel so i had yo do it woth no words again
And yet I know it is still the best chapel on campus
Lol
i'm about 85% sure that I will get this weekend off

Good morning
Love you
I miss you
This conference is despressingvand awkward
I want to go home
Why what's wrong
No one sees me im invisible every where i go
Do you think everyone already knows one another
No i just dont fit anywhere
You fit with me
Its all so pointless ill never get to make changes or take a lead
Do i though?
Yes without a doubt
Im not even rocking motherhood or womanhood lately
That's not true you are just under attack
You are my best friend. I feel so lucky to have you in my life. You are a great mom and a wonderful priest
Thanks i love you too
great news
0 good morning
Good morning
are you learning smart things?
Yes
i was up late last night and early this morning I am so exhausted
it will be good to go back to a slower pace next week
it is possible i may even be able to do some studying at work
That's good
I know youre tired im sorry im gone
no it isn't your fault at all
if anything it is their fault, i told them weeks ago that i needed this time and they said it was fine, and then i reminded this on monday and they were still like no problem
I still feel bad
totally not your fault it is far more important that i am with the kids and you get a chance to go on your conference.  don't feel guilty about traveling for work.  you have covered me when i've traveled a bazillion times
Do you know what the unique smell is in your car?
No
She didnt show up
Not sure what kind of answer that is
Whats that all about
Did you call her
Yes
No answer
Just emailed and texted im annoyed people suck
I'm sorry can I do anything for you?
No. Im just disappointed and upset
I'm putting chicken nuggets in for Josh, would Jude like some?
We are going to go to dinner
Oh ok
I cant win for losing today
Why
I suck at dosc golf
But in an adorable way that makes me love you more
Can we leave a little early tomorrow so i can bring jude to this tutor at 315
Totally
We'll have to make a plan someone just took me up on the offer to drive
Are you ok?
Im really worried about jude should i come home
No, he's barely sick
Oh ok you still going to dr tjough right
Heading there now
Awesome!
I love you. Let me know how it turns out
How did it go?
Strep throat
Getting g penicillin now
Hows it going
We're getting through
I think you should let me take both boys. I can put Jude in bed and do something at home with Josh
2032 Wappoo Dr

Bryson garage
remember i told you that i came home last thursday and had to do more work?
Yes
they didn't even look at the work that i end up staying up until almost midnight to complete.  i'm not sure why it was such an emergency for me if they weren't going to look at it
Ugh
Im sorry
i don't mind staying up and doing my part but if you are going to ask me to do something crazy like that then you need to make reviewing it a priority
makes me mad
Definitely
Sorry
it is what it is
i find the priority choices of my managers to be inexplicable at times
Want eome anti anxiety meds it really takes the edge off lol
lol
that's ok i have receeses cups
lol
reeses*
just heard from charlie
he said thermostat $180, will be ready tonight
Ok
I hace a meeting till 630 but maybe we could meet there and pick it up tonight
ok, when are your parents dropping off the kids?
bryan approved me for Mon Wed Friday next week
Cool
I don't know if you were iced up too ornot but it occurred to me that you can't meet me at Charlie's because I need to drive one of the cars home. I'm at the house when you get out of your meeting
I forgot my breakfast😔
Can you get something from the cafeteria
Fruit
Found a granola bar im good
Nurse think ponk eye might jusy be dehydration and irritation drink water wait till tomorrow
That's good right?
So this candidate is very confident he can learn everything about curriculum in a week
Thats a non inflamatory quote
lol
i like his confidence but it is somewhat condescending don't you think?
Yes yes i do
so not him then... did charles like him
if i make it home by 5:30 will that be good or do I need to be home by 5?
I have to be there by 530
ahh ok i'll make it home early
Im sorry
no you're good
i can make it home by 4:30
Ok
Totally forgot jude has titoring at 3 today ill make sure im.home to take him
Did you get. This rext
Sorry, iwe were on. A bike ride and I replied to the wrong person that sounds good
Ok
How's conversation
Its ok. I should not be in jeans and i have the worst headache
Perhaps you got all the old pertencious ppl there were lots of young priests in jeans at my conversation
All old white men here
On my way
We are just sitting down for lunch
Ok
this is, quite possibly, going to be the longest day ever
Oh no why
because there is nothing to do here
i'm trying to just study
Well atleast you get some study time
the audit is so bad that the dod didn't just post the audit on their website they are making ppl request it via the freedom of information act
Oh geez
So i seriously love this new workout
great!
Im feeling super sad about making jude go to og after a long day at school
well sometimes you have to do something you don't want, tutoring, so that you can avoid something even worse, feeling stupid in school
I guess. This sucks thoygh
life sucks
we all have to do it, it is just part of the real world
i don't like having to work or having to do the accounting class, or studying for my exam etc etc
you don't like dealing with charles, or not getting as much time to workout, or etc etc
I cant come home
Im sorry. You can stay out longer if you need to I can take care of things here
Foods here
Hey, we went fishing let me know when you want us back
I'm home
We are going to chill for a bit
are we at all concerned about our SSN on these forms?
someone brought in donuts... it is not helping my new health kick
Lol sorry
Did you get an amazon order for me yesterday?
i got you something on amazon today why
i just read up on the requirements and i'm going to need bishop lawrence to write a letter of good standing
Amazon said an order was delivered yesterday handed in person but I never got it and I need it for school tomorrow
i'm hoping that won't be a problem
I don't think it will be a problem just ask soon because might take a minute
oh no i did not receive any packages yesterday
yeah
are you going to be out on thursday night?
Can you call
If I send you this tracking number can you email USPS my phone won't let me
yes
do you have the email address?
No you have to go to the website
ok
9361289700090275725916
i may have messed up
i went on and tried to register a claim for an uninsured package and they made me set up an account
they need you to confirm your email address its the assoc.rector account
if you confirm the email it looks like i can fill out the rest of the claim on my end
I did
cool
was there a brand?
Bliss I think
it is saying that there isn't enough information to identify the package.  is there a brand name or perhaps a receipt?
sorry i know this is more trouble than you wanted
Natrogix Bliss Essential Oils -... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071RXT6N8?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf
I'm just pissed it was 25 dollars
ok i finally got it submitted
Thanks
Ok they want me to go to dinner tomorrow and Wednesday can you do that?
yes
don't you have a dinner tonight?
Yes
I'm actually super stressed about it
oh it was taken off the calendar, what time would you like me home today?
530
don't be stressed, it will be a good meal and either way you will have a job at the end of the day
I feel really guilty about it
why
My mom guilt is in overdrive
you mean not being home with the kids
Yes
you don't need to feel guilty about work
Ahhh but I do
you are a better person when you set boundaries and maintain your life
I feel like I should have done that with work this time
no, you almost always choose the kids you need to choose yourself sometimes
this should be a fun work event, you should go and enjoy it
I'll try thanks
it is good to have balance. i hope you have fun tonight
At least the food will be good company who knows
just try not to sit next to nick and charles which shouldn't be too hard because they will almost certainly sit together
TRUE
you can talk to debose and the candidate
It's a French restaurant never been to a French restaurant
which will have the side benefit of making you look good
i don't know that i've been to a ton of french places either
i'd say go with the chicken not the escargot 
lol
chick-fil-a is having a buy one get one deal today.  i was thinking i might pick up dinner for me and the boys
That sounds good
Maybe even take them out it's cold they'd probably like playing in the play area
ok, i was just going to pick it up and slum at the house but i can take them out
Do you love me
i love you very much
Do you know the email address for bees ferry
Weatherfords@charleston-sc.gov
I love you
i love you too
i'm looking at this process to get into the chaplaincy
it is almost like i have to restart my whole ordination process
there are references, background checks, a psych eval complete with a 180 question questionnaire pretty crazy 
Do you still want to do it
I'm a hot mess today
yeah it just sucks
I didn't sleep at all last night
i'm sorry
that always makes for a hard day
Well just go for it. I'm sure it will be worth it in the end
hopefully the dinner will be short again
Yeah
its crazy
there has been a lot of buzz in the anglican church about the ordination process and how it is so different across diocese
i think this crazy acceptance process is a by product of that
Probably
just added my flight to the shared calendar
What size t shirt do you want?
large
i put large on my sheet i thought
Okay
i passed my first REG quiz
What's that
REG is the next section of the exam

Awesome
i've been working on this for over a week and i finally passed something
so that's good
That's awesome
We got to the bus stop and just as Josh was getting out of the car to get on the bus he's all I forgot my backpack...
I'm sorry
I gave him 7 bucks for lunch and put him on the bus
That's good
Will you send me the motorcycle cover you want
https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/tour-master-elite-motorcycle-cover
Size XL
how's your office?
It's nice
I'm literally sitting in the corner in the dark.
Lol
I have nothing left to give
sorry
i know you have been all out with interviews and a new church and everything
It's ok then my mom needed me yesterday
what was up with your mom?
Just sad.
What size are your linen pants
lol
your parents just texted me about my sizes and I told them the sizes i knew and that i needed to go check on the rest
Ok
This candidate is a hard to lol
No
?
I really don't like this candidate.
how does everyone else feel about him
Her I don't think anyone likes her
well that's good then
don't have to worry about her
Do you have a taste for anything tonight?
Did I hear you say burgers? I'd like to make dinner and let you chill, I know you are worn out
How are things going with your mom
Ok it's like having a 3rd child
Sorry
She forgot again!!!
It seems like she is overbooked perhaps she isn't the best tutor for us
It was apparently my mistake I'm at the wrong library
I'm a big screw up there's too much yo keep track of
You aren't a screw up there is a lot going on and she keeps changing the meeting spot
you wouldn't have a service in a different place each week would you?
It would be so great if she just came to Jude at school
This is really hard
i know
i think it would be better for him and for us
Yeah. Prayers he gets in
Can you put the eggplant in for dinner?
i'll get it started now
And some fish sticks for kids
lol ok
Are these legends of treasure all one gift?
Yes
Stocking
Did we decide what to do with the target
It's for both boys
I know but we talked about buying g another or returning bc it is so small
Should I?
I think it's prolly fine but I wanted to check before wrapping
remind me
the kids are on my health but your dental right?
Yes
and vision?
No vision
do we want to get them vision, maybe just jude?
No I think it's ok
k
How's it going?
ok
my score isn't out yet
i'm doing open enrollment now
i'm doing both vision and dental cause i'm a big spender
and i'm dropping the FSA cause it sucked
Ok
morgan was talking about going to a catholic wedding and she was all "i did all of the things you told me to do and you didn't give me any of your snacks"
Lol
Do you know David rowe?
i don't think so
did you know that george bush died?
Yeah heard that
i'm out of the loop
the girl in my office taking the CPA is taking her REG exam tomorrow so she started taking practice tests today
Lol
i don't understand how she is solaissez faire and i'm a giant ball of stress over the same test
Because she knows she's going to fail and you still have a prayer of passing
Dudes basketball game got cancelled tonight so I think it's okay if he practices with Josh's team right
i don't know we should ask the coach
You are the coach can dude practice with us
lol
yeah i don't care
the hotel i'm staying at has this 
https://www.marriott.com/hotel-info/wasgn-gaylord-national-resort-and-convention-center/christmas-on-the-potomac/xyjvxiz/ice.mi 
they're ice sculptures
That's so fun
it made me think of you
I wish I could be there
perhaps some time
it seems like their may be less traveling next year
there*
Hey I know the Meeting with the bishop will be great love you
thanks I appreciate it
Jude got into Charleston Christian.
Are you excited?
Yes
When shall we make the switch
January but I really want him to get to see it first.
yeah that would be good
Do you think this is the right decision or am I missing up agai
we should talk to Josh too.  it will be hard for him to not have Jude
Yeah
i don't know if i'm sold on charleston christian quite as much as you are but i think getting Jude out of public school is a good idea
Why not?
i mean charleston christian probably makes sense with OG, vicinity, and cost 
i'm not as keen on "christian" education as I once was
Do you have somewhere else you'd like us to consider?
well that's my point I'm not sure there are a lot of option when you take out places that are too far to travel, too much money, or won't work with an OG tutor
I think our real viable options are do nothing or charleston christian
even charleston collegiate sounds like it is going to be a real hike
Yeah.
i feel like we need to be driving less not more
Charleston collegiate has a bus stop I can by in the morning. So that could work.
Agreed
and i want him getting the OG tutoring during the day when he is fresh not after school or on the weekends when he will resent it
i did the after school tutor thing and it sucked
Ok cool
what do you think the age cut off is on "young professional"?
i got an email from bryan about a networking event
i feel like if i'm almost twice the age of some of the ppl that might attend i'm no longer young
40
is that because you are 37?
Lol that's what my young clergy woman group says
oh i guess that counts
although the after age of clergy ppl is probably a little higher than the after age of accountants
True
what time do you need me home exactly tomorrow?  do you need to leave by 5 or be down town by 5?
I need to leave our house by 530
i will try to be home by 5 so you can leave early
I'm really scared I'm messing everything up
you aren't messing anything up, just believe in yourself
we are making the best decisions that we can with the information that we have
i love you
I love you too
Will you be home by 8 and put the boys right to bed. Jude has collegiate in the morning
Yes I'll get the boys to bed
Thank you

Bryan's office
That show looks fun I want to look it up and find out more details
Lol
This 8s what happens when we have too much unassigned time
That's funny you'll never we get a day off again
Jude didn't get in
No?
I'm sorry he didn't get in but but Charleston Christian is a great school
He's pretty devasted he loved it
that stinks
Julie said I can go to the training and if there's pd money left she'll even pay for it
That's a total score!
You should book that
i love you
I just saw a kidin the elevator with his jeans pegfed
Lol

Looks good
K
Thanks
I miss you!
I miss you too
Inside my hotel

Wow
I know right!
That's not even us, that's just the hotel
Are you up?
They were out of cik file sauce so I returned my order
Lol
You're ridiculous
Totally not worth it. The server did sorta look at me funny for a sec though
You're flight looking good still? What time do you get in?
So far so good, got here in plenty of time
American is a little low on customer service
I will avoid them from now on
Ok. I think I'm doing Delta
You should definitely do Delta for your trip
Their longer distance planes are nicer and the have movies
I spent two hours cleaning this morning and the house looks barely touched
And I can't find my academic hood
I think that is anxiety the house is clean
We will be fine with you gone
And I'll make sure the boys say goodnight every night
You're a good mom
Any idea where my academic hood could be
???
No sorry your office?
It's definitely in the house somewhere
Hmmmm I'd guess coat closet or laundry room
Do you want me to look when I come home
Please
I will
Thank you I think it's still in the bag and everything
Oh is it a white bag or yellow envelope
I think so
White bag
Folly Beach parade







Oh bummer I'm sad I missed it
Sorry
I'm kinda a mess
Brenda is late
You want me to go there
Can you meet us at sweet emotions hair salon?
Yes
Or here at John's island library whatever
When do you need the hood by
I have to be at hair by 345
She's still not here so maybe come here
No the academic hood
Tonight
Ok so what is the plan?
I can cancel the hair dresser
Oh didn't get it. I'm sorry I'm so much trouble I'm worthless
Stop the negative speak. You are not worthless you are important and valuable to me
I should be there in 10 if you want to wait outside for me
I'll be fine just come in
X I'm
Here
Are you coming in
?
Dance party up in this place

Brenda is a go
I was just about to call her
So I thought they closed at 7 but apparently on weekends it's 6 so I caught them just as they were walking out. I can pick your prescription up tomorrow morning and bring it to you or I can get it after work
After work is fine thanks
I'm so sorry I really thought I had time
No worries
i'm leaving extra early today to get your medicine
just wanted to let you know i've got it covered
Thanks
did josh tell you that he ate salsa and liked it
No
It is really hard to watch Jude get used to this retainer
I suck as a parent
you don't suck as a parent.  he'll get used to it just give it a couple weeks
what did you spend on my mom for christmas?
30
You ok with pizza tonight
I kinda feel like pizza
k
Picking up your meds now
This day is crushing me already
You just need more coffee
Did you get your score
Did you get your score
yeah
i got a 54
How do you feel about that
i feel like that is a little lower than i thought i was going to get
its not awful and certainly not what i wanted but it could have been worse
True
So do you want to keep going or masters?...
well i'm not sure a master is as realistic as i had hoped
i've looked at a lot of programs and they are all like 80-90 credits
i don't know i need to keep thinking about it but i'm thinking i'm going to finish out the review period and then take a break to get some certs so I feel like there is something on my resume other than church work and kearney
i've also found a mentoring program that the AICPA hosts which i think might be good
Sounds good. I'm proud of you I know it's hard to stay positive through all of this but you're really doing well
i'm sorry to let you know i know you guys have sacrificed a lot too for this
We are good I promise
Honestly it's way better than when you were at St james never around and unhappy all the time
I love you
i love you too
what does your afternoon look like?
I think I'm going to take the boys to the park while it's sunny and then go home and do homework and make a good dinner why
just wondering
What about you?
i have some hours i need to make up and i should really get a little extra studying done too
i'll be house around 6-630
It's totally fine. I know you have to take this next test. And I'm gone next week so if you have to work late nbd
I might even take the kids to the gym so I can work out
Can you call me
yeah

lol
bryan is trying to transfer his CPA to SC and he is going to have to take more undergrad classes
lol
Wow
yeah he went through the same headache i had
Bummer
Good luck at dinner
Thanks
how'd chapel go?
It was fine how are you
ok
i wish i would have worked out this morning.  it is just hard to fit it all in
bryan assigned work this morning
I'm sorry that's a bummer
maybe i'll get to workout this evening, we'll see
Absolutely in the boys and I are going to chill
yeah i think they are both tired and looking for some mommy time
Ok
i have been giving it some thought and i think you should come to the all hands party with me and then we can do ax throwing while we are up there
That would be fun
this is what i'm saying
although it is a drinking establishment which makes me a little nervous but i'm going to go with it

Lol
is this you?

Yes yes it is
lol

Or this
lol
the young girl in my office just said amnamals
That's funny

They asked to do that last week but we didn't have the time
Jude's gotten really good
He made it by half up two different paths
He's at a good age he is getting stronger but is still real light
Yeah
Are you still at work if you are can I send you this thing and will you print out 12 copies
I'm home but I can print it out on our printer
Your stuff fits in the suitcase with plenty of room to spare
Thanks
do you think it would be better for me to go grocery shopping right now without the kids or tomorrow while at ones in church
I'm going to pick up all the things that kids need to eat so you just need to worry about whatever you want
No it is silly for you to waste your time 8f I'm going to go anyways
I have to go to because I have to get all the stuff for my trip
I can pick up some contact solution and toothpaste at the drugstore
I kind of want to go to the store just to feel like in case I forgot something
Ok I was just trying to take things off your plate
My brother is in the hospital

tiRSh#2D6f
Just copy & paste
I can't figure out this zelle app
let me see if i can figure it out
Okay
i wasn't able to get on either.  i think it is the security features for the bank.
just tell her i'll pay her tomorrow or if she doesn't want to do that i can run the checkbook over
Okay
Okay
is this notebook on the kitchen counter for your trip?
Yes
ok i just want to make sure you don't forget it.  should i put it with your bag?
Chicken gyro plate no onions size regular
What did you end up doing with Brenda
We need to give her a check for 210
Tutoring is still 1245 at Earth fare right?
No it was at noon
Oh, I'm glad I double checked thanks
Damn
It's already 12:15 you missed it
It's fine
Yeah I just realized
Sorry
That's okay
Could you call her though
We need a set time it will be good when we get that kids time
Yeah
We have a set time from now on it's 4:15 on Fridays and 3 on Saturdays
Anyway I'm sorry I didn't give you more clear instructions
If you guys still go rock climbing could you drop a check off to her so I don't get confused about the money again
No it's my bad I should have asked
Her phone went straight to voicemail so I left a msg and said I'd be happy to drop off a check if she'd like
It might be better this way anyways the boys are exhausted
Ok- but I wanted to have it clarified that you owe for three lessons- including today. I charge for last minute changes because I've planned my time accordingly.
Sorry. The fee must be paid before he receives another lesson, as well. I have a lot of clients to maintain lesson plans and bookkeeping- I don't want to get complicated by having long over due accounts. Thanks for your understanding.
From Brenda
I get kinda annoyed by her tone
She never knows what the hell is going on it's a pain and then holds others super accountable
Yeah esp since she just texted me
It will be good when you have your training as well
I'm scared
You're gonna be great
I'm worried about the money worried we pissed Brenda off and she's not going to work with him anymore
We will figure out the money and frankly I'm kinda annoyed with Brenda being so flakey or busy that she keeps moving our times and saying different things
I'm sorry it's my fault
I have too much going on
No it's Brenda
They made me check my bag because the flight is overbooked
Please pray it gets to ok
Do you love me? Why? I feel like I'm failing at everything
You are amazing just take a breathe
I love you, it will be ok
I'm in the Uber car
I'm glad you made it safe and sound
How was the flight?
Fine. Tight quarters
How r boys did you get money to brenda
I think I'm going to cancel our Friday this week I'm afraid I won't be back on time
Just remember lunches (premade by me) and basketball tomorrow 5pm Josh 6pm Jude bus comes at 345
Thanks I got all that we already put together our lunches
You're awesome!
Good morning, I know you are going to be great and learn a lot!
That was possible one of the most crazy things ever, a nice parent jumped in and saved me
What happened?
Well I almost was late to practice and then we did passing exercises
The other parent jumped in and helped with Samuel
Oh that nice
I got into cooking dinner and doing spelling words and yeah crazy
Yeah welcome to my life
We still have math and reading andy dinner is only half cooked
Jude at b ball?
Yeah
You have a good day?
Yes
Learn a lot?
Yes I'm a little overwhelmed
You'll get it you are really good at this stuff
Thanks
I'll call at 730 to talk to kids ok?
Miss you
I miss you too
Spelling test is Thursday morning
I'm glad the training is going well
I miss you all. Boys need a note that they will be picked up at walk up tomorrow. Jude needs field trip shirt and warm clothes
Yeah you want me to call ur parents about the shirt
I'll do it
K5hanks
No shirt at my parents. I've never seen it so I emailed his teacher. I'll let you know if I hear back
You should make him check his bag and stuff though
So homesick today
yeah it usually hits me about day 3-4 when i'm away for a week
gets boring being by yourself
i'm looking at these tickets and we might not be able to get them without you
it says bring a photo id and the credit card used to purchase
I think if you print out the receipt thing we should be fine
If not you could call me
yeah i was thinking worst case i could get you on video chat perhaps
i printed it out already hopefully with us having the same last name and address it will be good enough
Hopefully
I hate I'm missing it
i know
we can call you right afterwards and the boys can tell you about it if you want
did you give your hotel my rewards number?
No it's a Radisson but one more night till free room on hotel .com
great
Both boys have x mas presents on the tree for their teachers. Josh can wear PJs . I think that's it for tomorrow.
k thanks
You should work out with my parents who's getting them off the bus I forget but they will stay with my parents tomorrow night so they need an overnight bag with PJs and clothes
Sorry to put so much on you.
Love you
❤
Can you call me when you get a chance
Wrote an email Jude's going to work in Ms Wolfgang's room this morning so he can do party this afternoon
Great thanks for taking care of that
i'm very proud of you and all the sacrifices that you have made this week for the family
you are a little bit like a superhero
Final is to teach a whole week of lessons to a partner here I go...
And, because God is good I just found your note at just the right moment
youre gonna be great, i believe in you
I want to come home now
Did you get in ok?
Yeah it was no problem
Enjoy the show! Miss you all!;
It won't bee the same with5you
Im so sad to miss it
Just found out the woman in this show I'm watching used to be Felicity
Yeah I told you that
Oh I don't remember that
Miss you
Just saw lordes
I want this househttps://www.facebook.com/1191740293/posts/10218474028460616/
I miss you so much can't wait to see you

You are coming home on a good hair day

Just found this in my sweater chest while I was looking for my ugly sweater
Lol who's that for
? A kid that we forgot to buy a present for????
Not sure oh well
My Uber is late
I'm stressing
You can look on the app and see where they are

Fun!
My Uber cancelled last minute I had to call another one.
That sucks
I've never had that happen
Yeah. Jerk face
Too bad you can't have the satisfaction of not tipping him
Honestly I'm pretty stressed and scared I hate traveling alone
Welcome to my Life me too
You'll make it and if not you can just catch the next flight it's early you'll be fine e
Did you make it?
Yep!
Can't wait to see you
I just got off the plane
Are you home?
Almost
I'll be at the house in about 20 minutes
Ok. That's early isn't it?
Yeah, we don't have anything left to do Brian left let us out early
Awesome! I'm starving what do we have in the house to eat
I forgot to tell you, I think I fix the fob for the Altima
Oh awesome!
It's just a sinus infection
Oh good
The boys were angels and everyone loves them
call when you get a chance
You took the tag off too so they won't let me return it
No big deal
I'm sorry, I kinda screwed up
It's ok
Maybe you can take it to a fossil store
Not really... What if I try to sell it on eBay
I've got one last place I can look for the receipt
That's fine
It's fine it's the thought that counts
I just found a letter in the van that Darryl and Sherry gave me $200 bonus
I also checked through the receipts in there it's not in there
you checked really well in the box?
i mean the one the purse came in?
Yes
they wouldn't even give you store credit?
No because you took the tag off too so they don't think it's theres
They said I could try at the Belk in Mount pleasant
i bought it at the mt pleasant one
Ok
i'm sorry i'll fix it
Really it's totally fine
i think you should try to return it in Mt P and if they won't take it just shop for what you want and we will give this purse to my mom next year
Good idea 💡
you might want to go online though this whole no returns thing is sketchy, they should be able to run my credit card at least and see the purchase
i'm going to call in a sec to see at mt p
Okay 👌
just talked to Roberta at Belk and she said she can use my credit card to return the purse.
Awesome 😃
You'll have to go though
i can do that
when do you think would be best to go?
If they can look it up on your card there's no rush maybe we can go on our date Saturday
sounds great
Lol oops got my black fedora schedule mixed up no show tonight
I'm on Thursday, sat, and Sunday
oh ok that's good right?
Yep ☺
Boys are having a playdate which is really great
awesome you looked like you needed a break from the crazy
Yep ☺
i'm thinking i'm going to buy some more tea, i just ran out.  do you want any?
No I'm good
We've been playing with different neighbors all day! #happy #nevermoving
have you gotten a chance to breath then?
Well you know it's loud and fun here but I did get a little research for my sermon done
so you know what you're gonna preach on then?
No lol
good lord woman just pick something it's low sunday
lol
I'm not great at sermon writing I want to play with creator of life so think about what things creator life for you as you begin next year...
does it say "creator of life" in the prologue?
Yes
Im struggling keeping up with everything
i'm sorry
Jude's lessons, the house, preaching, us and work it's a lot
it looked like the OG stuff is a lot of work
I know you usually take the back burner
what if i take over the house cleaning stuff
I'm worried about tomorrow night because I'll be out till midnight tonight
Probably exhausted tomorrow. Should I change it to during the day on New year's
I'll probably be better by then
how about i sleep in our bed with jude so you can sleep in in his bed
I mean I'll still be up early it's just how I am
we can do new years if that would be better for you
I think it will
i want you to be able to have fun on the date.  I don't want it to just be another chore
I don't want you to feel like it is another chore but I'm always holding up so much it's hard to juggle everything. I think New year's day is better
ok lets do that
and let me know what i can do to help you
i'll try to keep the kids entertained when i get home if you want to take a few hours to work on your sermon or lesson planning or what have you
I have the show tonight
Which I'm.glad about but still
Exhausting with this cold etc.
I love you. I swear I'm doing the best I can to care for you and the boys
I know you are. We are very blessed to have you
Taking my mom and kids to movies at 4 just so you know
ok sounds good
Logan and his bro we're looking for the boys
Oh sorry
no problem for me just thought it might be something you guys could do if you needed a break
Can the boys have a playdate later or do you need the whole house
no, i can lock myself in my room or i can even leave and go to the library if you'd rather
We are coming home at 230 for a playdate
lol logan just came by to see if they were here again and told me the same thing
he's very excited, its cute
Everything ok? Just saw you called
Just having a moment
I feel guilty when you don't come with me and guilty when you do. This may have been a bad choice
You're fine don't feel guilty we found a lessons and carols here
Where?
Good shepherd
Ok I just hate it takes an hour for the kids. I spent all morning cleaning and arranging the playroom so this won't happen again
It's no big deal
In case you're wondering,yes, he's still here cleaning
OMG
It's gonna look awesome!!!
Is he still there?
Yes
Best day ever!!!
I think we are going to come home soon and do a bike ride
He just left
That's fine do your think
How does it look
I've got about 2.5 he's left
Good, he said we should vacuum the whole car once more when it dries
Okay
Ladles is closed, do you want me to pick something else up for you
No it's ok. Thanks though

?
Nah
Sorry
You do you though
I'm fine with leftover spaghetti
Ok. I'm gonna make a salad
i keep thinking today is monday and we have basketball practice tonight
I'm a hot mess today
sorry, how come?  is it the kids?
So it's possible I can't be Orton certified because I don't have a teaching license
that's rediculous
ridiculous 
Yeah bummer but I guess it doesn't change anything
not for jude, but it might get in the way if you want to tutor
Yeah it is what it is
how's it going?
I'm.ok. you?
learning stuff
i sent the tutor an email and haven't heard back yet
bryan said that when he was in college they would give him free napster.  the young girl in my office said "what's a napster"
That's funny 😂
lol
Can you call me
yes one sec
I'm headed home now
I made you a really good steak
the tutor got back to me
their price is 110-160/hr which i think is too much
i found another group that is more reasonably priced at $66/hr
unfortunately they want the first 36 hours upfront to lock in that rate
they said i can pay in installments too as long as I pay it all in 6 months for no interest
How much is that total?
2400
they also said after picking that plan i can get more hours at that rate or get a refund for whatever hours i don't use
i can get a cheaper rate but it will be more per hour and i'm locked into the higher rate then
its not a rush, we can think about it because i'm not going to start until the week of the 21st i think
i think we can pay it off 100 per week so it won't hurt so bad
Okay
at it sounds like if i start down that path and find it not helpful i can refund the hours i didn't use as well
Okay, sounds good
I say to for it
i'm sorry this CPA thing is costing so much money
No big deal
Turns out I kind of love Henrietta and I'm really going to like working with her
henrietta is the OG west ashley person?
NO New middle School shopping
oh the new chaplain
great! i know it will be nice to have a friendly face on campus
Yes
persumable she has to at least agree with you on some of the discrimination stuff
and perhaps on the women in ministry stuff
I totally forgot I have a black fedora show tonight can you be home by 6
yes, no problem
Thank you
my manager came by the office and dropped off a bunch of food that they didn't eat, odds and ends really.  everyone else turned their noses up at the food but i'm all this is awesome!
i'm eating artichoke dip for lunch on fancy italian bread
That sounds amazing
its yummy ppl in my office are young and stupid
Good news! My car magically fixed itself no more beeping or air conditioning problems
Can you get up with boys in the morning? I'm.so exhausted. I can't see straight
Yes just lock your door
Thank you
the rule for tax deduction for personal property is $25,000 per year of the excess of 50% over AGI
clear as mud right
Yes
Sorry. If it helps my day with the boys hasn't gotten any better
that's not better, i was hoping that you guys were at least having fun
is your back any better at least?
I couldn't get in there was an hour wait
i'm sorry.  maybe you can make an appointment and swing by there on the way back here this afternoon
It's fine
from the tax code
(40)Indian tribal government
(A)In general
The term “Indian tribal government” means the governing body of any tribe, band, community, village, or group of Indians, or (if applicable) Alaska Natives, which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to exercise governmental functions.
i guess "indian" is the right term
Who knew
Just distilled water. Make sure it says distilled and not purified
Thanks, sorry your back hurts
I'm just going yo loose my shit if I have to listen to any more whining
Why don't you drop off the groceries then go out. I'll take the kids until bedtime
We are making lunches and cleaning the house
Something went wrong on my study program
Oh no

I think I broke it...
Awesome!
do you have a crazy day today?
Yes why
just checking on you
i put jude's sheets in the drying but they will likely need to be fluffed and put back in when you get home
Okay
just found the tax stuff about selling a home that we were talking about the other week
Under current law, gains on the sale of a personal residence up to $250,000 ($500,000 for married individuals filing jointly) are excludable from gross income under IRC §121, provided the taxpayer has owned and used the property as their principal residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years. Taxpayers do not need to buy another residence in order to take advantage of the exclusion. 
however, i'm pretty sure that if we take the money and put it back into another house it would be exempt either way
They said I can do the practicum so yay!!
that's good
congrats
you should maybe still go to the west ashley one and see if there are ppl you can connect with there
Thank you so much for all your help around the house lately. I really appreciate it
It makes my life much more manageable thank you
i love you
i walk in today and bryan is all we should be 100% billable from this point forward
Oh no!
Say you are sick
i'm already in the office
it will be fine
I'm sorry
no worries it would really suck if i thought that i could get a good day of studying in and be likely to pass tomorrow
bryan just told me to take the rest of the day as sick time to study
That's good
what was it that you told me about on the 10th?
i want to put it in my calendar
I think I'm good we will talk when I get home
k
Why don't you let me get the kids off the bus today and you can go to the gym or work on your sermon, whatever will help you de-stress
My parents have them gym day I'm in McClellanville
Right, I guess I knew that. You were talking about the gym yesterday and I guess it just threw me off
Soooo exhausted how did your test go today
It was actually easier than I thought it would be
Okay
Good
I .want still prolly didn't pass but I don't think I got a 40 either
You'll get to do some sermon writing when you get to your office which I always found to be a good quiet time activity
I have two meetings
I thought those weren't till tonight
With parishioners we are clearly out of sync
The car just turned itself off in the middle of the street. I was able to start it again but that's weird right
That is weird I've never heard of that
Awesome! Lol
i think this probably needs to be the last year for the black car
Probably
did you see the email $50 a night at the dunes right now?
Yeah
Awesome!
I need your social
Number
For pension
226 39 0881
Thanks
I'm getting more pension now
good, you can support us in our old age
I was thinking maybe the long weekend at dunes
This weekend is crazy with first b ball games and oyster roast
I'm already exhausted
i know
we don't have to do it right away
you said you had a show tomorrow right?
Yes
what time will you need me home?
Whenever you want ☺
are you saying i don't have to go to work tomorrow?
Lol sorry I thought you meant tonight tomorrow by 6
ok i'll add it to my calendar
Finished my sermon thank God!;
that's a good sermon, short, simple, it says it all
If you get a chance could you give me a call I just need to hear your voice
I told Jude I'd take him out to eat
Okay we're coming home now and then we're going to take a nap
Could you wait and take them both out to eat for dinner so tooth can up to
I just scheduled a meeting with a prospective tutor for tomorrow at 6 but if you want to do hang out before we can
I won't get home until 530 it's cool I need some alone time. If I send you a list could you stop at Walmart for me
yeah i was going to hit walmart after work tonight.  Josh needs night time undies
and we need light bulbs
I need bows for presents, pita chips, dish soap Greek light yogurt
Thank k you boys and I should be home from gym by 7
So good news and bad news
Good news is apparently I do get reimbursed for travel to st. James Santee as part of my employment contract
Bad news is we are going into the year $30,000 in debt
why is that?
I don't totally understand. Apparently about 5 normal pledgers didn't pledge or haven't pledged yet
But even that only takes us up to 15,000 that is missing
oh the church not us
No not us. The good news for us is with my travel reimbursement we could buy a new car if we wanted
It's about 250 a month
i'm not surprised about that.  churches are always in debt
30k is a little high but yeah i'd just figure out the ppl that haven't pledged yet and have someone call them
So I talked to Dr Plano today. And we both think that it would be a good idea for me to start with trying to lose some weight
So I ordered some Arbonne stuff to help me is that okay with you
the arbonne is fine but i think you should consider a different doctor because plano clearly doesn't understand
Okay 👌
one of my two tutors bailed on me
i need to decide between an Indian CPA (but i'm nervous about his accent) and a woman who works for the AICPA (the institute of CPAs) but she isn't a CPA she is a lawyer
Bleck
There's no other choices
there is on other dude but he wrote like 3 sentences in his profile.
Hmm. I'd go with the Indian
i'm thinking i might try both.  i can split my time
Ok
i was avoiding the indian guy but he says his specialty is FAR and REG which are the two tests that i'm working on
Okay
i have a meeting with the girl tonight and i'll make my decision after that
Okay 👌
the advantage with the guy is that he would be really good at international accounting standards
TRUE
I'm about to run into chapel
ok sorry to bother you
i know you'll be great!
how arey ou doing?
I'm ok. Do you want me to call Connie or will you call tad
i called them this morning and they weren't home.  i told them i would call back around 5
Okay, thanks
I have to do a hospital visit so so much for my night off
ppl get sick at the most inconsiderate times
I know
I have the worst headache
if you want i could take the boys out on Friday night so you could get a night to yourself then
We'll see
i think it would be good for you and us
That might be good
i can take them out for food and then something fun
Yeah
sorta a last horah before i go back to study mode
Yeah

how did chapel go?
Good. How's your day
ok
the government changed the way that they calculate this one statement which is causing a headache for everyone
Bummer
yeah.  in the age of corporate transparancy the government is deciding to show less information
Awesome! Sounds about right
Things have calmed down a bit here. Thank goodness
yeah maybe you can work on your sermon today
just a reminder that my office is doing happy hour today
Okay. I just got a call from the school so I'm going to pick up Josh now he's sick
he was a little cranky this morning
They think it's flu
that's not good
It is what it is going to the doctor now
It's the flu going yo get meds now
oh no
poor munchkin
Yeah 😞
This sucks! I suck
you don't suck, kids get sick that's what they do
it is not a reflection of your parenting
in truth, the little stinker probably takes his jacket off as soon as he gets on the bus
Could you pick up Josh's medicine at the Walgreens on Savage road and 61.
They didn't have it at our normal Walgreens
And maybe a thermometer to
can we put you and josh in our room for sleeping until you guys get better?
Yeah I'll clean sheets etc today
i think i can do the basketball thing on my own if you guys want to lay low tomorrow
I think that's going to have to be how it goes
i'm doing this training today and they are talking about what to do in an audit if you aren't using a computer.....
who doesn't use a computer for work in 2018???
What that's nuts
there's a vending machine here that never gives you what you ask for but its only $0.50 so we keep going to it
That's literally the definition of insanity
And the only thing to make me laugh today so thanks
i got a yellow lemonade and tried to get a cherry coke
the best part is that there wasn't a yellow lemonade as an option
Lol
how's munchkin?
Sleeping. He feels awful poor baby
I cut my leg shaving. You would think that I had sliced off my entire hand with the amount of blood that is everywhere.
that's no good
Lol
ask jude if he'd like to see bumble bee (transformers)
spider man and aquaman i think are too late they don't start until after 6:40
Yes
ok
A mentally I'll parishioner just called me to say he's has a divine revelation
tell him dinner and a movie
Ok
what as the revelation
I have to call him.back but he makes me nervous

Nah just soup

Josh wants to say I love you
lol
Can you put the pizza in the oven for me
Warming up oven here
Thanks
Bryan said he wants me just to take a sick day today
Ok. Is he mad?
No I think someone complained about us teleworking
Oh
Did kids get off ok
I made you shephers pie but would you like me to bring home anything else?
No, you are the best. Thanks for making this
how's your day been?
Pretty good 👍
good
it seems like taking St. James has helped some with the PG stress
Definitely
Jude has a fever
Oh no I'm sorry
Just when we thought they were better
i gave bryan a heads up that i may need to stay home tomorrow to watch Jude
Would you like me to bring you breakfast this morning
What was his fever last n8ght
100
How's my boy?
I need to be done with the sick
me too
You don't need to rush home we are going to get a snack do homework and be sick
Jude basically just wanted to play Legos by himself all day
Everyone got 5 guys and we are doing a lunch and learn it is awful
Sorry
No worries.hpws your day going
you need me home by 5:30 right?
6
ok even better
Why what's up
just thinking about the rest of my night
Oh okay
Does it mess you up to be home by 6
no
i'll be leaving soon
Ok kids and I are going to Chuck e cheese for a bit
sounds fun i'm leaving in 5
I don't want a new car
https://www.carmax.com/car/16952067
What to you think of this?
Any thoughts on where cough medicine might be for Jude?
Nm
I don't think we want a Ford
Then I think we are out of luck.
It's ago. I'm fine with the car
https://www.carmax.com/car/16872455
That one's good
Apparently I have to stay and watch them I didn't know that lol
Mom fail so much for my run
Well it is a gym. Maybe you could do push-ups and pull-ups in the corner or something
lol
Check out a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Sport FWD - $15,829 - $15,829 on CarGurus at https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/share/225635574
Better year better mileage 1000 less even without the haggle
Did you see passengers side front bumper scrap up
I think that's just a shadow
Oh yeah I see it now still...
We can probably get a little more off and a little more for our trade in...
Might be worth it
We can probably get them to fix it if we pay what's asked
I'm very proud of you
So they just called about the down payment. You want me to try and put it on the credit card? If I can't where is the check book
yeah put it on a CC
i don't know i think the checkbook is in the kitchen
did i tell you that when i was looking for the title i found the title to the tuson
lol
Lol
how's it going today?
Pretty good 👍
I'm going to go pick up the boys from school and then do you a bunch of errands and we're going to do some art together this afternoon
you are such a good mom
How r u
good i've completed most of the work I have 
i'm feeling good about this CPA thing too
it is good to feel like i have a plan
That's good! I'm proud of you for sticking with it. I know it's really hard
I really do think you should take the money you make when you get your CPA and put it into a bike
i think i was just feeling a little discouraged that i was getting low scores
maybe
I love you I'm glad we're married
so i think my study plan is MWF 5-9
Sat noon-8 and Sunday 2-8
Ok I was wondering if you could change your Friday to Tuesday. We have ninja and are out late that night anyway
yeah that works
OK car is all set
nice
how is your new car?
I love it
good
i prolly need to call usaa and see if i can get a loan
Yeah.
I know I needed to run errands but I feel really bad for the boys
our boys have a pretty awesome life.  if they have to run errands once and a while it is not that bad
how's today for you?
Pretty good Charles is trying to say I can't claim.housing
i think i may have heard something about that because of the new tax law but i'm not positive
No. Trump says it's ok. His CPA says no because this school isn't a parish
but it isn't worth the argument with him either way.
So don't take it?
it isn't reserved for parish priest only
Housing allowance next year
oh next year we are definitely going to take it if we are allowed
I know
this year i will figure it out when i get to our taxes
next year you will have been in a parish for a full year and you are working full time as a clergy person
i don't think there is a parochial restriction though
Ok
i think you're a great mom
Thanks I have that school improvement committee meeting tonight
do i need to come home then after work?
No I got my parents to help
how did it get so cold all of the sudden?
I know right!;
So the house is not going to be clean and life will be a mess but I think Josh needs some time with me tonight so it is what it is ok?
yeah i don't care about the house being picked up.  I agree he seems like he needs some mommy time
Ok cool
i switched the sheets to the dryer before I left but you may need to put them through again before you head out if you want them to be dry for tonight
Sounds good
my back is so sore from the chiropractor yesterday
I'm sorry
i guess that means it worked
did you see that tysons is recalling their chicken nuggets?
Oh no what kind
Tyson’s White Meat Panko Chicken Nuggets were produced on Nov. 26, 2018, and have a best if used by date of Nov. 26, 2019. T
i think it is the 5 lb bags
the picture doesn't look like the ones we get
Ok
I'm having the worst panic attacks today
why, are you nervous about something?
No I'm just exhausted! And, lonely and the boys have been very needy
i'm sorry
you said we didn't have a game this saturday, maybe we should go off and do something as a family for the morning
That would be nice.
i love you
I love you too.
i'm ready for today to be over
It's mrs. Willems birthday tomorrow can you pick up a $10 gift card to Chick-fil-A
completely forgot that this was super bowl weekend
So...
i just wasn't sure if you and your family did anything for the game
we know i'm not going to watch it
We will probably go to my parents as usual without my brother
Did you have a good day?
Yes
You?
It was good, not a lot to do here right now
what are you guys up to tonight?
Lisa is over
oh fun
its nice that you get to have a friend over too
is Josh cute playing with his girl friends?
That's Sunday
oh sorry i get all these days confused
It's cool
What's your plan
i was thinking i'd stay and study for a little bit
i won't stay too long
i just want to finish this chapter
Okay
No Rush...I cleaned the house to get ready for tomorrow
you are amazing
i appreciate all the work you do
i'm sorry i'm always away
Thanks. It's ok. I'm glad you are getting to work on this CPA. It's good for you and us.
Maybe we shouldn't go.
We are here
I have the worst cold...
Oh no!
Yeah bummer
Could you please help clean the house for your aunt
Maybe you should rest when you get home
Yes I was going to
Thanks 😊
We need laundry detergent
Nevermind, I found the new 5
One
Thanks for dropping my computer your my hero
i try
glad it helped
I'm.supposed to be at this levture tonight at 8
oh right yeah i just finished up here
i'm heading home.  thanks for the reminder
You don't have to rush I don't need to leave until.730
I'd stay and study no point in rushing in this traffic
how are you doing?
I'm okay the librarian had a family emergency and I ended up setting the book fair up all day
that is sweet of you
would it be ok if i meet with my tutor on Friday night?
I have a show but let me see if I can get out of it
if not it is no problem i can do my meeting on Saturday
Friday is just her first available
Let me check I kind of want to get out of the show anyway
ok
I'm off for Friday so go ahead and do your tutor
ok, thank you
No problem.
are you home right now?
i passed the pre-test for this section because i rock
I suck
what's wrong
it seems to me that you have been running all over the place all day, i think you are kinda like a super hero
i'm sure the librarian thinks so
and i'm sure the boys think so too
I'm headed home now
Ok
so what do you think?  Andrea is awkward around me because:
a) I'm a guy b) i'm an anglican priest and she's an episcopalian or c) she's just an awkward person
She's just awkward
Am I a bad Christian for letting my Muslim students do prayers to Allah
no you would be a bad christian if you taught your muslim students muslim prayers
chaplains must perform or provide
Thanks
chaplains aren't really in the business of evangelism
i got a 52 on REG
Is that good?
it's not aweful but it isn't great
the girl in my office got some 30 and 40s i think
It's not the test you just took or was that a practice exam
the test i just took
the one that changed like 2 weeks before i took it
Well I'd say that's pretty nice then
yeah i think it isn't embarrassing 
so i'm going to meet with my tutor on saturday at 1.  the friday thing fell out because when she said friday she meant friday morning
That's fine
sorry about the mix up
It's fine 😊
Can you call me
sorry, you dropped out and i needed to be in a meeting.  i'll call when i'm out of this meeting
It's okay
my manager just asked if there were any dates in march I shouldn't travel or that I need vacation can you think of any?
i don't see anything on the calendar
Nope I think you're good
k
Can we find some time this weekend for me to have a couple hours away?!
yes.  you can go saturday evening or any time sunday
Ok thanks
you cancelled the show you had tomorrow right?
Yes
what do you think about us putting the kids in front of a movie and I get take out and we catch up in the playroom?
it sounds like there is a lot going on in your life and i'd love to hear about it
no pressure though if you aren't feeling up to talking
the magnolia garden's thing is this weekend if you still want to do that
I did flash do still want to do that but I have a vestry meeting after church I'm not sure what time I'm going to get home
if you want i can push my tutoring to afterwards and we can do that after the basketball games on saturday
it goes 11-3
not that we need to go the whole time if you don't want
I have to check the game schedule. And I'm hesitant to have you change your tutoring.
I think we can figure out something for Friday
i'm pretty sure the last one is at 11
it's no big deal but sooner rather than later would probably be better if i'm going to do so
I love you


Will power none for me
Look at you guys having tcby
Good for you
What time r u coming home tonight
It isn't great ice cream anyways
When would you like me home?
Whenever you want
My plan was between 8-9 but I can come home sooner if you want some adult conversation or some time off
No that's fine
I'm heading home now
Bryan came out and asked if anyone wanted to eat out and we all brought our lunch
he had that same dejected face that he had when he talked about no one coming to his super bowl party so i got lunch with him
That's good
I'm picking up my medicine now. What time did you say your tutoring is tomorrow
are you still at work?
1pm but i can move it back if you want to do the chocolate thing
No let's plan something for next weekend when I feel better
k
I'm just trying to figure out what I can do with the boys so not I can also rest
i mean, most parents just say "go play" i think if you want them to just play in the backyard it would be fine
Yeah maybe
By the way I forgot to tell you Logan will not be at the game tomorrow
bummer
he's one of our better shooters
I know
i know you hate the basketball thing but you are doing a great job
Oh boy do i hate it
lol
Could you pick up some NyQuil like the real kind for Cold and flu on your way home
yes absolutely
bad news
i just got the tentative travel schedule
looks like i'm out march 15-16 for all hands back for the weekend then out the next week possible for two weeks
Ok
i'm sorry i know that sucks
Actually it's better than some other dates because one of the week this spring break
Bryan is giving me a hard time about taking sick time for an allergy appt
apparently in order to take sick time for a dr appt i have to tell 5 different ppl and add it to two different calendars
Soo many hard conversations today...
Can you bring home some NyQuil
i have a dr appt at 4 and then i think i'm going to come home to study and see if i can avoid the rain
Okay
My parents are taking the boys to ninja because I have a school improvement committee meeting tonight
oh ok
did you want me to take them so that they don't have to take them two nights in a row?
I don't think you llbe back in time they have to leave by 4:30
no, i guess not... i could probably do tomorrow though if you need
i love you
i'm glad you are part of my life
❤
it looks like our client is dragging their feet which means we are not doing a whole lot now and we will be swamped when this deliverable is due
annoying
I'm sorry
just a bummer it will mean lots of overtime and late nights that we don't really need to do if they would just get us stuff when we ask for it
Over time is good pay though
true
I'm having the worst panic attacks
why
because of the boys?
No 8m just tired I think
you should go to bed early
i love you
You too...I'm a hot mess today
I'm sorry, you want me to call you
Three small boxes of chocolates for teachers
Two ten dollar gift cards for boys and two small teddy bears
One bag of heart lollipops or chocolates
I love you. Thanks for the card and beautiful flowers. Can I ask for one more thing....
Marcus in my office went to starbucks but doesn't like coffee so he got tea and and a breakfast sandwich but he doesn't like eggs so he just got cheese and bacon on bread
lol
Lol
I can't even leave to go to my clericus
why?
that is part of your job
Yeah sorry wring text
I really need your help with this financial stuff if I have all the data now could you look at it for me
Help me put it into a budget
I'm having crazy bad panic attacks again today
yes no problem
Thanks
yeah just give me what you have and i'll get started and then i'll probably come back with questions of other stuff that i need
Ok. Are you going to work on it at work or at home
I can send it to you now if you want
at home
if you have it electronic you can send it now though
Ok.
out of curiosity, do they have any financial statements?
I don't think so
that's ok, i didn't think they would i just wanted to check
Ok
how certain are you that this is all the places that the church spent money last year?
I can't figure it out and it just makes me angry.
Not certain at all.
that's ok we will start here and move forward.  your's won't be the first church that had to start from scratch and build up
the pledge information didn't come through
Ok...I think I could be really happy just working at Dunkin donuts though
no it would be boring and unfulfilling
but i get the sentiment
i'll get this budget turned around for you and you will look awesome
But coffee
Thanks
then we will put it into quickbooks and the problem should be fixed from there
Okay do you think we need an updated version of QuickBooks or QuickBooks for nonprofit
both
you want the latest version of quickbooks nonprofit
i think they have moved to a subscription service these days
Yeah it's like 900 dollars
Hmm.....
the nice thing is that i believe quickbooks is fairly self explanatory 
Ok cool
i haven't played with it in several years now but it was when i got certified
Ok thanks
and quickbooks is what most firms use for client books
Cool
we'll look at your numbers and decide what we think there is money for
Want to take the kids out to dinner tonight
sure, where
Good question
lol, well if we are taking the boys to dinner it will probably be fast food
...
maybe we could go to ihop
I don't want to go to IHOP. The last salad I got there was so gross. We could go to Moe's or CiCi's or Jason's deli
We could try O'Charley's kids eat free there
yeah but the kids said it was gross when your parents took them there before the fire
let's do Jason's
Ok
Bryan said that waffle house pulls out candles and gets fancy for valentine's day
lol
That's funny
how's your day going?
Pretty good
You?
i'm ok.  your dad and i are thinking we will work on the fan after the games tomorrow
That sounds good
Call me when you can
what did the dr say?
Didn't take him no fever I think he's just exhausted going to bed at 730
good
how's his face looking
Ugh
Crazy accident right outside our subdivision so close but yet so far...
Go ahead and eat without me I can't come home right now
Take all the time you need. If there is any way I can help you left me know. We love you very much.
apparently in the world of texts and cell phones the phrase "standing on your soap box" is too antiquated
Whose our mortgage and car loan with
That was so embarrassing
i've never heard of a bank running a credit check to update an account
that's crazy
i'm sorry
😢
if you get a chance can you make a copy of your license for me
i'm going to have to do this snail mail thing to get the permanent removal
Okay
My head is swimming
do you need to talk
I canceled my gym membership and my clothing membership
Why
I'm not going to host anything for the basketball team this Saturday okay
sounds great
i don't think we need to
Okay 👌
how are you doing today?
feeling any better?
I'm okay.
How r u?
ok just worried about you
I just need to figure something out to make next year more manageable. I'm going to think and pray on it
Unfortunately I have to ask for what I want sometime in march
why?
is that when your review is?
Yes
Right now I'm being trait how to stop a school shooting. And rethinking my career
don't worry rich ppl sue they don't shoot
we had several serious conversations about church shootings when i was at st james in a classically southern fashion
It's like super depressing
mental illness is very sad
Will you need ice cream after your meeting
Im literally not sure I can handle it. I feel super traumatized
This guy is from isreal and he's teaching us their defense
have you had to jump on anyone today?
Not yet
it's friday
i think our life would be so much better if we had more 4 day weeks
You're right
hey would it be possible for me to drop the kids off at your parents this coming tuesday?
Probably
i just looked at my calendar for next week and realized i'm supposed to do some recruiting on tuesday
Recruiting?
at the college of charleston
Oh ok
i mostly volunteered because it will be good for review time
That's good
ok so scratch that
turns out they only need me there for 1-3
Ok
I'm.so sad
Will you be home by 8 so my parents can drop the boys
I'm heading home now
Okay 👌
Can you call my parents and work it out with them I'm trapped here

?
Blue
Jude was the last Man standing on his side in Dodge ball
His strategy of duck and hide is serving him well
Okay 👌
We are stopping at McDonald's
Okay 👌
This sucks
We are never together. How could you even want to be married to me anymore
O love you very much. I know it is hard to have so much going on but I will never stop loving you. I'm very proud of all that you are doing
I really needed to hear that
i broke the crockpot dish.  i'm going to buy another it is $15
Okay
Whatever
i just had my meeting with marshal
How did that go
it was good
he basically just wanted to tell me that i was free to do whatever I want at the parish but that there was no pressure if i wasn't interested or ready to do so
Ok
How do you feel about that
i told him I think i have too much going on to try and add anything else until i finish my CPA
Okay 👌
do you think that was the wrong thing to say?
No. Unless you want to do something. And then you should do what you feel called to do
i don't know what i want
i'm just trying to get through and then i'll figure it out
just booked my trip
I get that. I would trust your gut. You are smart and capable. This is only for a time
looks like i'm not coming home either weekend
Send me the info
i'll be gone from 3/15-3/28
three different hotels
Okay
Wow
yeah
good news though, i'll get to see my family and you don't have to come
lol
Finally headed home now
Can you bring Jude to the dentist on Monday at 10 40
Actually forget it I'm just going to call in sick
i can do the dentist if you want
i'm better at that stuff
Ok
But it's an extraction so I don't know if he can go back to school can you take the whole day?!
If not maybe we could split it you take him I'll sit with him in the afternoon
how many hours do you have for sick time?
I get nine days a year I have tons
i have 7 days left
like 58 hours
if you want to take half a day that's fine i'll take him to the dentist and you can sit with him
that might be better anyways, you've been saying you need a day
How was your day
not bad
how about you?
Ok. Jennie started emailing my secretary with requests for the website but didn't cc me
Weird
jennie as in the previous priest?
Yes
yeah i'd nip that shit in the bud double quick
that is a total violation of her roll and disrespectful to you
Yeah I know
how do you feel about that?
At first I was like OMG I better get on This
Then it turned into screw you lady you gave zero right
yeah i totally get that
i think i would be pissed and then after i cooled down give her the benefit of the doubt and ask her nicely to step back once before completely shutting her down
because i'm petty i wouldn't do whatever she suggested even if i thought it was a good idea
but you are a better person than i am in that respect
I've pretty much decided I'm going to ignore it
it is good that your secretary told you instead of just doing it
that is why you are a better person than me
Yeah my secretary is awesome
a guy at work says that because i drink tea and wear sweaters i'm a hipster
Your work is way more fun than mine
And hmmmm maybe
lol i thought it just made me old
So I need to have a rough draft budget by this weekend.
Go with hipster you've been old forever
i can try to create something tonight
It doesn't have to be tonight
it will be very draft though until we get the actual program to put the information into
I can go thru too and look for numbers
Which may be awhile since the computer is still broken
wait which computer is broken?
Church one
oh
yeah the problem that churches run into is that they don't do continued maintenance so everything tends to break at once
Yes
do you currently have a microsoft subscription?
they apparently posted this picture of us at the job fair on facebook and everyone is laughing at me because i'm standing tall with my chest out and bryan has his shoulders slumped forward
Hahaha
Do you think it's stupid for me to go visit that school in McClellanville
no hurt in looking
it would involve a total change in our whole living situation though
Yeah 😞
not that we can't do that, there would just be some logistics to hash out
i love you.  i'm so thankful that you are in my life
I love you too.
so the last couple of times i've been adjusted i can feel it when my adjustment goes out
like i feel a click in my neck and then i get a headache and the next day my back starts to hurt
that's bad right?
Wow. Can't decide if that good or bad
Maybe can you tell what's knocking it out
well i only get 21 adjustments a year so i can't do anything about it until my next scheduled appt
yeah i look around and it just pops out
That's not awesome
no, i think i am going to tell rick next time i'm in
Good idea
it never used to be like that
Hm you may just be more aware though
Do you have any idea where the remote is
last i saw it it was on the table in front of the couch.  i'd check the cushions
So I think I fixed the budget
Are the kids getting on the bus this afternoon
Walk up
I'm a mess today
Don't want to go to this diocesan event don't want to be here just a stress ball.
marcus just said for his birthday he is going to get a big arcade video game that he is going to put in his living room
hows it going so far?
Not bad ☺
great!
see nothing to worry about
Yeah r u working late tonight?
yeah i'm going to try to knock out this partnership accounting stuff
its the last part of this section
my plan was to not study tomorrow though because we have the bank thing
Okay 👌
Jude just got asked to audition for the gymnastics team
That's awesome
wow he must be really good
Yeah
So you are taking half a day on Monday to take Jude to the dentist right
yes in the morning
sent the email on tuesday i think
Awesome! I may have you drop him at my parents so that I can come to school. They aren't going away now
oh ok that works
would it be better if i take the whole day?
No
What time are we meeting at the bank
i have it on my calendar for 5
i'm leaving work @ 4 to get there
Okay
Okay just so you know I have it down for 5:30 not sure who's right but
Whatever
Hey Mr. Agnew just called and said Josh got confused and is in the front office. Let me know if you want me to pick him up.
I got it
I'm just gonna meet you there
Okay
Your parents personally invited me to dinner
Thats sweet
Yeah I was going to study but I feel like I need to go now
My brother literally comes for an hour 530 to 630 if you want to do that
Dinner cancelled
Is everything ok there?
Moma got a fevor so im taking the boys out to dinner
Oh ok sounds good
Would you like me to bring you something from Moe's or I'm picking up groceries I could bring you a pizza you choose
moe's would be great.
Ok
home wrecker with beef, rice, beans, sour cream, cheese, guac, hot sausa, and chipotle southwest dressing
thanks
i have the worst headache
Not good
it is making it hard to get this studying done
Maybe hust rest then
I'm gonna muscle through I'm almost done with these lectures
Ok
Go to bed early maybe?
You should see if you can find any more hummus snack packs
Did you get a different brand of night time undiess because they didn't fit? I'm at Walmart now
Yes can you get the regular ones
Will you tell me whats going on with jude when you know
Yes
She said they are crowded which can cause lots of issues
I told her to go ahead
The kids dental is through to right
You*
Yes
Bummer i feel si sad for him
Yeah bummer but it is better than the alternative
I had a little freak out because I forgot that the kids were on your dental
Done
Thank you 😊
Is he ok
He says he's sleepy
They said sorry for a couple of days in don't brush for the next day
Soft food for the next couple of days
Poor baby
apparently, your dental covers the operation but not the gas so we had to pay for that
weird though huh?  you think they insurance agency really thought ppl didn't need something for the pain when pulling teeth?
Sorry
i don't care about the money just weird
How much was it?
in any event, jude seems to be doing ok.  i dropped him off at your parents and he plopped down on the couch
70
NBD
Ok
Hows it going at work?
we are starting to pick up
which is good
although today i have to do HIPPA training
blah
Oh thats good
Blah
it's is actually a pretty big deal though
Im sure theres all kinds of legal repercussions
we just lost a huge contract that we have had forever because someone lost some PHI
yeah
Oh no not good
yeah i think a principle got fired over it
I met with charles and nothing catastrophic happened
so you didn't talk about anything of substance then
Ummm he tried i didnt give much
how's my munchkin?
Pretty good
good
What are you up to?
it is a bummer that he has to be so familiar with the dentist
i'm going to work until 6 and see if i want to continue to study after that or if i'm done for the day
Makes sense
how are you feeling?
you need a break?
I'm okay 🙂
We went to the gym so im good
oh good
did the kids have fun going?
Yeah
BTW i already washed josh's sheets
Thank you
just didn't want you to rewash them

Not sure if my watch is trying to tell me something....
soemone at work gave me tea to try and it is red
can you call me
how's it going?
Not good
how come?
I just got kicked out of US Ashes because i didnt take them and charles was mad
i'm confused what is US Ashes?
Uppwr school
oh right
Its fine i have an extra free hour next year
why didn't you want to take ashes?
i don't think it matters, Charlies has almost no control over your life
Bevause lower school doesnt and honestly spiritually i just wasnt ready
i'm sorry, it sounds like a tense day
It is which it's kind of why I didn't take ashes. When Millions of kids are coming up to me asking me why I have them on my face it bugs me to tell them I get them but you don't
I'm not at my best self today and I won't handle that well and I won't be able to be the best spiritual leader I can be
When I told him that though he told me I would either put them on next year or not be asked to do this R Us
Tbe service
it is a weird dynamic at your school
Yes yes it is
i'm very proud of the work you are doing.  I know the day to day is hard but it will be worth it.
Can you pick up the boys when you are out of service i wont be home till 9
Are u in a service
Not till 630
hey
What's up
i'm just thinking about you
Yesterday was hard
you were rushing around this morning and we didn't really get a chance to talk
i know
you'll get a chance to catch your breath today though right?
Yes
would you like me to come home early so you can take a minute?
Yeah i have everything fone for the vestry retreat and next weeks chapel now so this afternoon and tomorrow should slow down
No i want to spend time with tje boys
ok
How was your day
yesterday?
it was fine
Yes
What church did you end up going to
i just had my performance review training and i've got to decide if i want to say i think i'm ready for a promotion
i went to jimmy's church
What do you think
it was a sweet church
i think i always feel anxious about answering the question
Yeah. I always think theres no arm in asking if you use the right wording
i do think that i've learned a lot but i'm not sure if i am management level yet
well if i say yes he could either say yes or no
Yeah i hear that give it a year then finish your cpa
if he says yes then i'm held to sr. standards if he says no then that's somewhat awkward and perhaps he will not listen as closely when i am more ready
i don't know i think i just over think it
Pray about it
But my gut says wait our life is alrwady so complicated
i'm just thinking that if i get a little bit more money it could solve some problems
Not really money isnt the answer i think contentment is
you didn't seem like you were feeling very content with the drayton hall answer yesterday
No im not but ...
Im not sure how money helps
extra money would allow us to choose a different school or perhaps even move to a different district
Different district but we could do that now
i don't know if we have it in us to make another move right now
Theres no privare schools so its drayton or move right now
I'm done for the night
Are you going to bed early tonight
I dont know
what is your evening going to look like?
Not sure 🤔
Why whats up
Did you want to do something?
well i was thinking since you are going to be busy all weekend and i leave next friday i would come straight home and we could do something
maybe we could go out to dinner or something
How about we see if my parents will take kids sunsay or monday and do it then
I dont want to take them with us and i shouldnt ask this last minute
we could do that, i know that they are going to have a lot on them while i'm gone for two weeks though
I think its fine. Im out of the school the second week that you are gone. So its just one crazy week
oh good.  i was feeling bad
I might atay in mclellanville tomorrow
Not sure but haven't written a sermon yer
that makes sense

Josh made breakfast
Lok
Lol
Jude says he really wants to go to the movies today with you. There 8s a question if it is just you two or if Josh is going too
I think I figured out why Andrea doesn't like me
Why
I talked to her mom, she's a crazy Episcopalian from VA she was talking to me about "all of those anglicans that are a little skewed"
let me know if you want me to get home early so you can rest
Yes please
i will leave right after my last meeting for the day
I was thinking i might take the boys to lego movie we will be home by 630
that's perfect
my last meeting ends at 5 so i'll be getting home around 6 i think
would you like me to make us dinner or do you think you won't be hungry?
ohOH
i'll bring home some greek lemon chicken
Thanks
Jude has come home crying everyday for awhile
Why
Bus or school
School...i think hes feeling really beaten down
i'm sure he is but i think it is about reminding him to keep his eyes on what is important and then speaking life into him 
how are you doing?
I'm okay 🙂
How r u?
good it was a pretty productive day for me
That's good 😊
wanted to let you know that josh left his backpack in your car so he shouldn't be getting off the bus with one today
Ok
Im going to go yo bed early
That's a good idea
Im.exhausted
And i have the early service tomorrow
i was just thinking about you
is it still 1-2 ppl at that service?
Yes
that stinks
i'm sorry]
perhaps you can use it as a dry run for sunday
I have to go to this pg thing tonight. Ill look like a shmuck if i dont uts an end of chemo party for a teacher its at 530 im going to bring thr kids and not stay long
No worries I just scheduled my Lyft it will pick me up at 425 tomorrow morning so I should probably get to bed early
This sucks!
Yeah but I have to check a bag now, which is an extra line, and they don't want to spend 200 bucks for me to park for 2 wks so here we are
What is going to suck is that I will then have this party until 1 the following morning
i know it is a bummer that we haven't gotten to spend much time together in a while but know that I love you more every day and i totally understand that you have a lot going on.  I am very proud of you and all the work that you are doing.  I'm even proud of the work you are doing at PG.  I know that is hard work but what you are doing there is the slow work of changing an old institution and it is important work
Thanks! I needed to hear that. I love you too. I know your working hard and traveling sucks. I love you for taking care of our family. I love you more each day
i think the hunting trip may not happen now
That might be good
Row 5 towards the back before the construction
I landed
Oh good
turns out that when you wake up at 3 you are starving by 10
I'm sorry
Can you call can you call me
its all good
yeah i'll call now

Which one goes better
With the black suit
I know you aren't feeling well and you have a lot on your plate right now just wanted to remind you to pick up the van from the airport when you get a chance. Thanks!
Got it last night
You're amazing thanks so much
Did you save the receipt
Yeah
The kids ate driving me nuts
Tell them to go play outside
How was it with your family
Sorry I missed you we are just finishing up dinner and then 8m guessing they will drop me at my hotel. It went well. How did the boys like the art thing at the rec center?
They liked it
Everyone was in a better mood after that
Good. When's your black fadora thing
It was this afternoon
It wasnt fun i dont like the rewrites
Is that the general consensus

I feel like a lot of my lines got cut
You've talked about quitting
Yeah its probably time
Did you know i turn 39 soon? 39 !
Really?!?!?
You don't look a day over 24
Liar

Ummm that would be awesome!!!
I know right. I didn't win
Bummer!
Maybe we should go for judes 10th and my 40th next year gulp.
They gave me 10k of fake money to gamble and I turned it into 100k and I put it all on the Disney vacation raffle and still didn't win
You aren't turning 40 next yr I am
Maybe we should let you loose in atlantic city
Lol
I think I'm good at gambling other ppls money
Wait am i turning 38 in three weeks?
Lol
You're 37 I'm 38
See how I making you younger

This trip may have been a bad idea
It will be fine. It is good for you to get away sometimes
Left the key and a note in the mailbox can you let then know
I hope you guys have a great trip

No thats ok ill see if dad can take me
If i do that though can you get home for my haircut
Also, pretty sure I fixed my bike. Just needed a little TLC
Yeah I could totally make you bile like new. I thought the point was you wanted a new one
No im.good finances sre tight i dont want anything
I want to get my hair done and have the rest of the day to myself tomorrow
I think I can make that happen
You want us out of the house?
My flight is getting in at 1
Okay. New plan. I don't think you should plan on trying to be with the kids tomorrow if you're not getting in until 1 a.m.
I'm sure I can ask my parents for some help tomorrow and you can see the kids on Saturday
Trying to woek around your schedule and my schedule is too hard
I can make it happen I'll take them to go jump
Soooooo .... I don't know when I'm making it home but it won't be tonight
My first flight isn't supposed to leave until 11:15
I think we are going to have to rebook for sometime tomorrow
Ok just let know what happens. Im sorry i know thats fruatrating
I just feel bad like I'm letting you guys down.
Airlines are crazy its not your fault
I "should" get in around 2:30pm tomorrow
Okay

I probably can actually my hair appt should be done at 2
But i dont want you to have to wait around if im a couple minutes late so you choose
I don't mind waiting I'd love to see you
My hotel last night looked like somewhere you'd find a prostitute
Awesome
We passed just about every hotel in Dallas to get there and. The headboard was gold faux alligator skin with CZ button all over it
OMG why did you have to stay there
It was free
Oh
The choice were a Wyndham or a quality inn

I just cant
for whatever its worth there was a big period in the middle where he didn't cry at all
Yeah when hes not with me
I'm sorry I know it's hard to watch him be so sad
Ive lost who i am un the endless pile of need
I cant see myself anymore who i used to be
maybe, i think you are who you've always been.  you are the care giver, the lover, the helping hand
you have always been those things
you are still the one that is overcoming and rising to the need
i know it is exhausting though
What time r u coming home
I don't know 0robably not til late why so you need something
I can change my plan
I was planning on stopping at Walmart on the way home
I have to do tuesday treats tomorrow so i need to run to the store
Do you want to tell me what you need and I'll get
Ok
Cheese platter, fruit platter, 4 things of muffins and some cookies
Actually do veggie platter no cookies
Do you mean the bakery packs of 6 muffins
Yeah like the nice kind
Any particular flavor or just whatever looks good
Whatever
I cancelled my bf show

it is important to know your limits
Okay
I'm coming home to rub your head

Im sorry i know you came home for me
you are worth it every time
Im at church and tje stupid church trouble maker is here and i just cant force myself to go in

Im.good
I think it might be fun to go to the flowertown festival this weekend
Whats wirk looking like for you
I asked of I needed to work this weekend and they didn't know
I'm guessing that means no
We can do whatever. I feel like I haven't seen you guys in a while because of all this work so I'm going to take the weekend I think
So if you have to work late tonight is the better night because i have a show tomorrow
it will be fine
what time do you need me home tomorrow?

A little
at least you look cute while being crazy
😊
I made a bunch of thai chicken seperated into tupperware so you have food
You're the best thanks so much
I'm done for the day
Ok
I know this makes ne a terrible person but my accompianist for chapel called out tomorrow. I was at school until 515 and i now have to rewrite chapel
that sucks
can't you make the music teacher or someone do it
No one can
i'm so sorry.  that is the worst
music is a headache
Yeah.
i know you worked really hard on your chapel too

Look who tried to come to my office today
He's like 6"long
They forgot to invite our audience
So that happened
nice
no better way to say we recognize all your hard work than to make sure opening night has no ppl in attendance
Right
maybe it will be like a soft opening for the kids so that they don't have to worry about all the ppl the first time.
how you holding up today?
Im ok
good
Do you think jesus is being mocked in the palm procession or try honored
hmmmm
i think that he is being honored
i feel that way because it speaks the the vainglory of human tribute that they could honor him as messiah one day and crucify him the next
Me top
plus i think that the procession, right behind the procession of the sacrificial lamb would have caused the pharisees to stop and pay attention to what was one of many who claimed to be messiah
Ok good i had someone give me the alternate view and i started questioning myself
claiming to be the messiah, as i understand it, was insignificant it was when others started to believe it that it became a threat to the ensconced powers that be
well liberal theology typically takes the easy way out
it would be easier to say that he was mocked and the pharisees were pleasing the crowds to kill him
my head feels dizzy
Imsorry
when are you getting home?
Now why?
i can get out about now too
they are pulling this deliverable now
Ok
Do you want to atay2 and study
i want to but i'm also feeling a little tapped out
I understand
maybe i'll try and stay for a few hours
i'm just worn out
I would give yourself tonight go to bed early and then study tomorrow
You just started an antibiotic dont push it
ok
Wanted to let you sleep we are at the movies
how are you doing today?
you getting sermons written?
Im ok...no ended up a busy day but ill figure it out

True
What time will u be home

I need yellow and white notecards

Yes please
k no problem just normal 3x5 cards?
Yes yellow and white
0 I'm going to get your flashcards right now
Do nt rush im not going to make tjem till morning
Oh, in that case maybe I'll wait until the traffic dies down and study here
Ok
Im super depressed
why? what's wrong?
I think the allergies are just getting to me
And i feel like a bad mom
you are a great mom
if anything you are too good to our children
Thanks 😊
How r u
i'm ok
how's sermon prep going?
Ugh
you'll get it
you are a good preacher
just give the spirit time and give yourself a break
perhaps what you need is a long walk to clear your head
Whats up with you
studying
Hmmmm
i got a little bit of studying done today during the day and i'm trying to rip through some more 
why do you need me home
Good for you...no
today is one of those days where i should have just stayed in bed
Oh no!!
everything is just annoying me today
I'm sorry
Im craving real chinese food
well we should get some tonight
Ok i know this is going to sound ridiculous but i think i have a spot of skin cancer
how dark is it?
i can look at it when i come home
Its not its white
i'm a bit of an expert because almost everyone in my family has had it
i don't think that is skin cancer
Ok
it is usually darker than a freckle and oddly shaped
Another one bites the dust
we just had another person announce they are leaving
Leaving or fired
leaving
she will actually be moving to be a remote employee
morgan's bf needs to move to key west for work

They are giving me shots ill be bettee by noon lio
Lol
I need some serious head rubbing tonight

i found a good friday service after work
ironically small little st timothy's has every holy week service including tenebrae
i wish i would have found that earlier i would have loved to go to tenebrae
Thsts nice what time
well now i'm wondering if i should go
there are all of these tornado warnings
Oh really
Bryan just let us out early
Im.on the road should i be nervous
I can be done when you are ready to come home
Jen has cancer
That's not good what kind
Eye

I guess they canceled services no one's here
Oh 😞
Weird small chapel maybe?

You want a grilled cheese
No thanks
Be home in 10
Okay
Where are you?
We ended riding to Grandma's come over whenever we are still the pool
I miss you already
i miss you too
i hope you guys have fun at Franky's today
so no shit my whole team has their flight cancelled so i'm going to be conducting the first meeting with me and one other associate in the room
Lol maybe you should have put in for that promotion
i know right

Omg
Yeah not good say a prayer that no one was in the car
I will
I love you
I'm not ok
I feel like I'm failing at everything...
You're doing a great job
I know you are feeling overwhelmed but you are actually doing a great job at everything
You are very hard on yourself
I spent all day today talking with big doners who think that I marginalized their white teenage boys when we talked about implicit bias
So yeah that happened
I'm in the car I'll call you when I get back
Just left the hotel to come home.
So what's your plan?
My office is doing g a baseball game on Monday the 20th you guys want to go?
If you want what time?
it will probably be a late night
looks like the weekday games start at 7
i don't know that we need to stay for the whole game but maybe 7-9 or something

Do you think I should be concerned. It's from my allergy shot
Yes call the Dr
they said take some allergy meds and put some ice on it
Ok
I don't want to go to the baseball game but you can take the boys.
ok maybe you could plan a night out with lisa or something
i should tell you that they boys were having some trouble getting to school today but especially Josh.  I tried to get it out of him what was going on and he wouldn't tell me
Ok...I'll look into it
Julie would not like me to go part time so I think I'm all or nothing
it sounds like if st james went half time that you could get out of PG all together which may be God's blessing on you
Today I got the rest of the supplies for the party cleaned the downstairs vacuumed did all the toilets folded and put away the laundry made dinner and lunches
I'm exhausted and I hate birthday parties
You are on overdrive
Could you do me a huge favor
yeah what's up?
Could you go to Walmart and up the stuff I'm ordering on line
After work
yeah no problem i can do that, i'll come home first and then go back out.
i need to go get some stuff anyways
Ok....thanks
I left school early to stop at Walmart so I'm all good
YnM Weighted Blanket (20 lbs, 60''x80'', Queen Size) | 2.0 Heavy Blanket | 100% Cotton Material with Glass Beads. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073451HTY/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_txpYCbH98TDAF
I do really think I'm being called to part time at PG
It may be a little tough financially st first but...
You can try but it sounds like your options are all or nothing
I think your best option is tutoring and then get a second church
I think if I'm concrete about it. I stay part time or not at all they'll say I can stay
you took the PG job because you wanted to be in ministry not because you really wanted to do elementary school chaplaincy.  now that i'm not in the church anymore there is no reason why you can't focus more on parochial ministry you just have to have andrea have the hard conversation
don't you think that julie will then just be a giant bitch until you leave because she didn't get what she wanted
Good point
Andrea needs to go in and say the diocese is low on priests and we want jill at more than one church if you go half time you get her for half the sundays otherwise you get her one sunday a month figure out what you want
She's not going to do that
she can say it nicer but that is her job
She's not going to say it
She won't she already told me that
so she as like wow that parish is taking advantage of you, wow that sucks sorry about that
Yes
She said I signed the contract
She's not wrong
yeah, i guess that's true
I do think they will go up to half time eventually
yeah
I won't be here if Julie is pissy
But I'm not ready to leave the actual chaplain stuff
you don't think dubose would say whatever without asking her thoughts first?
I'll tell her first
probably a better way to do it
Yeah I bet I can convince some of my time is better than none
i think you should lead the conversation with a video clip of charles preaching
Good idea 💡
Hows my boy?
fine i just put him to sleep
he'll sleep til noon have some lunch and we will see if we will do legos or back to bed
Ok. Is he dying?
you don't need to come home until dinner time you should go do something for yourself
Do you think I need to cancel tomorrow
no he's fine
no worst case senerio we can give him one more day in bed and do the party in the afternoon but i think he'll be fine
scenario* 
Ok....I'll be home I promised Josh I'd pick him up at the bus stop
Are you working or is this a sick day?
sick day i'm just doing some study time and taking care of some chores i have
Ok cool
My parents are going to help with the splash pass for birthdays
So I messed up can you give me a call
what time do you want me to show up with the pizza today
6 pm four pizza from Little cessars
i just looked up a maid service they are around 130
i was thinking we could give it a try and see what we thought?
I just talked to Julie PG would like me to stay full time but she is fine if I leave at 215 to get the boys
So if you are cool with the morning drive I think we are good
what do you mean if i'm cool with the morning drive
oh taking the boys to school
Yes
what's the name of the school again?
Jennie Moore
and they need to be there by 8?
is there a early drop off option?
Apparently you can drop off as early as 7 05 school starts at 725 and ends at 230
Word on the street is if I'm there by 245 we are good
it looks like if it is a 7:05 drop off we'd need to leave by 6:10 and I'd be in the office by 8ish
it's a crazy morning but I could make it work
Hmmmm ....
honestly it will suck leaving at 6 but if it were an 8 drop off i think it would be a hard sell to bryan to let me come in by like 9:30 so it is better this way
There's an in between too they can get dropped off by 725 so you could get in by 830
apparently there are a whole lot of ppl that only work T,W,R
Why is that
Google says that traffic on M and F is basically non-existent
Oh
anyway you slice it i think i'd be getting in the office between 8-8:30
with normal traffic
I don't know what do you think?
it is a long day but i'd be willing to figure it out if we were sure that Jennie Moore would actually be doing OG with Jude
perhaps a phone call just to confirm what the specialists use?
I called she's of trained but it's not explicit og
well, perhaps its a leap of faith but if she knows that we are doing OG at home then hopefully she would know how to speak that language at school as well
I agree
But my truth is if we aren't considering moving at all we will run into trouble with middle school
So may be not worth it
well we have 3-4 years for that and I imagine the process will start over at that point and we will look to school choice again
it is entirely possible that we will be moving out of SC at some point.  I think we have to make the best choice for what is in front of us now and let tomorrow worry about itself.
It's a lot of driving I'm not sure it's worth it
I love you...I'm scared ..there's so much going on I'm scared I'll get it wrong
i love you too
i agree there is a lot going on
we will likely get some part of it wrong
but we will also get some part of it correct
the important thing is that our kids are loved and cared for and they will receive their education no matter where they end up
there are a bunch of ppl in my office that grew up in SC and they still have the same job as me
So, i think the first question is are we here for the Long haul.
i think we are here at least for the rest of the kids elementary school ed
I think I want to stay here until the kids graduate if we can find good schools
graduate from HS
Yes
I want to settle and my family is here but I don't want to deal with school choice forever
I've got two good jobs you like Kearney
i think if we did that we would have a good down payment for wherever we ended up next
But couldn't we move once more secure a spot between my two jobs near their school and commit to being there for 10 years
this is a conversation i don't want to have on text
Ok
I'm just scared
i know but it will be ok
i'm getting 4 cheese for the kids and a deep dish pepperoni for us
Crap I think it's going to rain
it says only 15%
i'd take those odds, we'll be fine
Ok
Sóoopp many drunk parishioners
Josh is refusing to eat anything gluten free
It's ok I'll deal when I get home
bryan was complaining because ppl weren't emailing him back.  So Devin said yeah haven't you ever been on a dating website before
lol
Lol
i was talking to my parents and they were like don't worry about bringing a present for your dad's birthday and I was like good because my present is a plane ticket
i'm pretty sure they think we have a lot more money than we actually do
Yeah...you should probably have that talk
yesterday i was talking to them about retirement prep stuff and they were like don't you have a 401k
i was like they offer it but i don't have the money to put into it
I'm sorry
i don't think it would make a difference they are incapable of imagining a world outside of NOVA
That's true
You can start a 401 k if you want
as i mentioned i've been giving it some thought and i think it would make the most sense to put it with hassan
Ok sounds good
with my roth we will be able to pull funds out of that tax free after retirement
That's good
how was chapel?
It went well
do you have thoughts on when you'd like to do the mother's day thing?
the way i see it there are three options
Ok...
we could do it tonight, we could do it sunday when i get back (around 5:30) or we could transfer it to next weekend so you can have a full day
Can you call me?
yeah 
i want to come home and just hangout with you
What time?
now
i don't feel like working today
i also don't feel like going away tomorrow
I'm.sorry
Are you going to have enough hours
yeah i'll work until 4:45 and then 2 hrs of study time and i'll come home
i took the shrimp scampi out of the freezer for lunch
not sure who the portion size is for but i'm pretty sure it isn't me
I'm so confused
i want to go home but i can't
I want you to come home
i'
i'll see what i can do, maybe I can use some vacation time
It's fine if you can't it really is. I just wanted you to know you're loved
i just feel like we have both been doing a lot of working and not as much time with each other
I agree we knew this time was going to be crazy
yeah
i just miss you
i just asked and i can leave at 3:30
Ok
i'm actually a little nervous now
he said I should wait until 3:30 because of the core hours but tomorrow i'm going to be hoping on a plane at 3
Ok. So I'm confused again
i think i need to be better about just saying no to my parents
they always ask these things that end up being a huge deal
Yes.
I really don't want you to add getting in trouble with work to the list of things that is annoying about your trip
You're already leaving work tomorrow for family stuff.
yeah i'm thinking i'm just going to stay
if he said yes i'd go but since he said wait i might as well wait for the whole time
Okay so what's your plan
i'll be home around 7ish
Okay, cool
sorry i tried
It's fine. I'm going to make steak for when you get home
thank you
We can cuddle on the couch
We are going to hit the pool for a bit.
k
I have the worst headache. So we watched a bit of TV and I haven't made dinner yet
you should drink water
I have I think it's allergies
there's drugs in the downstairs bathroom
I took some thanks
I thought you were coming home at 7 ?
Sorry lost track of time
It's ok. I just wasn't sure nbd
I feel really bad you came home to see me and I was dying
i feel bad that you were dying
i wish you would have stayed home and taken some time
I'm going to go home early
if my flight keeps getting delayed i might have some good time to do nothing
I thought you were going to say it wouldn't be worth going
if they cancel the flight for today i'm not going
i'm not going to go so i can turn back around the follow day
i know my flight will be delayed coming home too
Bummer
Turns out I'm not ok
Dogj
Do you need me to cancel
No but super bummed
I wanted to have fun with the boys but I'm a hot mess
I think you should let them have a sleep over with your parents
Pick up tomorrow at lunch
How come I always get the fat guy in my seat
I think it is God's sense of humor
Lol
I think he should pay for a quarter of my ticket since he's using a quarter of my seat
Finally made it here
Oh good!
Hope your feeling better
A little how r u?
I miss you
Looks like my flight might even leave early hope to see you soon. I really miss you
How was your trip
It was fine. I checked the box and they were happy I was there
Well that's good.
The whole thing wasn't great for me personally but whatever
What happened?
I hate it here
Just because it's so busy
Yes I hate all the ppl I hate how nothing is real I hate the plastic I hate how judgemental it all is I just don't like it
Or does it have to do with your family too
Some but just in general I don't like it
I got that
Tiph and Erica we're so gracious to show such great hospitality and their home is beautiful but it is fake
My aunts were there and we started talking about the school system and they were just judgemental
It just wasn't a great experience for me but I'm glad it meant a lot for my parents I think it was the right thing for me to do
Yeah. It was probably good for you to go.
I always feel inadequate after I leave your family
Yeah, they were pressuring me to go to Thanksgiving again
I wanted to be like no I'm not going on Thanksgiving I want to feel thankful
Betty del and Connie called us high maintenance parents
Connie was like if you want your kid to get reading help you should be home schooling if you don't like what the school is doing
What does that mean?
And then I punched her in the face
I was infuriated
Yeah whatever. I don't think there's really a right or wrong answer on these things.
I landed
I broke the vacuum
I'll look at it
It probably needs to. E taken to the shop or to be replaced anyways
No it's definitely done do we need a new Dyson or can I go with a mission?
Bisson?
Let's talk when I get home about it
Okay
Miele Classic C1 Pure Suction Canister Vacuum Cleaner, Graphite Grey https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P97CD5T/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_3Tg2Cb3S4NX7P
I don't love it
Dyson Ball Multi Floor 2 Upright Vacuum Cleaner, Yellow https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NAGRRRU/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_b6g2CbVKZNHC4
You forgot the cc
Yeah I'm a huge fuck up
I didn't say that I'm asking if you want me to bring it to you
No it's ok. I won't need it at school
I'm the worst mom. I did it all wrong no wonder everyone thinks I'm crazy
You did t do anything wrong your a good mom
My aunt was talking out of both sides of her mouth
She has spent her whole life looking at the latest research in education she can't very well get angry when parents do the same
I just hate how they treat you. And it makes me feel like I'm inadequate and not the right person for you
You know how our neighbors been working so hard on his lawn
He put something on it that killed it
I feel bad for him
Bummer
Dyson DC33 Multi-Floor Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner (blue) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3WJ8A5/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_Ziv2CbKEAWXQ9
This is basically our current vacuum in blue. I think we go with this!
we never did get around to talking about this
do you just like uprights better?
Yes.
So I can deal with any upright
i'm totally find with a dyson, i was thinking miele because ppl that know things about cleaning and vacuums say that they do a better job
miele makes an upright
but like i said I can deal with the dyson if you'd prefer
They Miele is more like 500
yeah they are a different level of vacuum
if you want to go dyson that's fine
Let's go with the Dyson but you have to order it because credit card...
k
my face hurts and i'm cloudy in the head
You need to see a doctor
i have an appt tomorrow
i want to talk to my allergist so we can look at the larger system rather than just fixing the symptom
Good idea
if the way that this allergy shot thing works is that i'm not going to be covered through allergy season than I need him to figure out a stop gap for that problem
I'm going to pick up some drugs on my way home, you want anything
Chocolate almond milk
K
Thanks
we didn't find the necklace
Bummer
yeah
i felt bad for him
jude came up with the great idea that it may have felt out when you were on the bike
we back tracked a little bit but the bus came so we called it off
Ok I'm sorry I feel bad
no worries
it ended the argument about why they can't watch tv
I'm having the worst anxiety attack about this meeting. And, I'm all thrown off by my parents taking the kids today
You want to talk about it?
No it's ok
I'm sorry you are stressed can I do anything to help? Maybe I can do the kids lunches and make Josh's bed
i think the vacuum is coming tomorrow
Awesome!
My parents offered to take the kids on Friday night
that would be great
you want me to plan a date?
or would you rather go simple
I don't know...
I got some disappointing news today
I'm not going to the training that I asked for...
oh i'm sorry
do you want me to call you?
No...just a bummer once again having trouble seeing how I fit here
Sends my head into all kinds of not great places
well i'd say even if you don't understand your place you must have an important place if they won't let you go part time
so my allergist told me that that nasal spray that i thought was so great had a side effect of making you more congested after it wore off
and as i was using it quite a bit that is probably why i got so impacted
Well that's a bummer
yeah i feel like that warrants a note or warning or something
i threw it all away when i got home
Yeah really
That's good
I don't want to go to this other training it's like week after OG
are you already signed up?
No I'm not going to go
ok
you deserve a break
What's my online banking password
Forget it I got it
you got it
ok cool
Yeah and I have the OG training
don't be worried if you need to take out a couple grand for that we can figure it out
Ok ...
just let me know when you write the check
I sent it last week remember
i remember talking about it last week i don't remember you saying you sent it then but that's ok
Sorry they just got it today
no worries we had enough in there so it was fine
i love you
You too
Jude didn't do well on his map scores
Only went up by 2 points. He's bummed and embarrassed
yeah but the score doesn't really mean anything
he has test anxiety and i'm sure the teachers have been building the test up
my head might explode today
I'm sorry
I hate my job. Im sooooo bored
you should find something to do while at work
go back to school or learn a new skill
maybe you could learn a language
or you could just become a professional video game player....
i might die from the pollen
I know me too
My mom just told me she can't get the kids off the bus and I have us carpool
So annoying
what time
It's fine I'll figure it out
the earliest  I can leave from work is 3:30
It's fine I got it
but if you need me to I could probably get Bryan to let me do the last hour at home
I'll let you know I'm hoping someone here can help
how are things going?
So apparently Home Depot still does the bathroom installation if you ever want to go check out their price
I will be home at 3 and would love to take the boys swimming
i found a hotel for $80 that's 4 stars but its 40 mins away do you think that's too far?
Yes...
how about 10 mins away for 100 prepaid
i think this is the hotel i'm going with.  it is a springhill 10 mins away with a pool and free breakfast for 380
Sounds good
Do you want me to make Josh go to the game tonight even if he doesn't want to?
i was hoping you could take the time to yourself
i do think he'll have fun once he's there but if he doesn't want to go ...
I'll see how he feels after school
This morning he said he was exhausted
i know he said he wasn't feeling it this morning
bryan's going for a final count now, do we want just have Jude and me go?
i think he'll be fine
You choose
i'll bring him
i think he'll like it and if we leave him out i think he would be sad
Going to be hard with your company and he whines the whole time that's the only thing
so you think i should just tell him he's not allowed to come
No he should go
a girl in my office has the hiccups.  i think i work with children
Lol
Can u call me
not right now i jus stepped into a meeting
i can call around 4
Okay
Are you having fun?
i love you
hope you have a good day
You too. I am faking it till I make it
would it help if i came home at a normal time a couple days a week?
I don't know. I want to get 5he bishops perspective today and then we will talk
Part of me does think everyone is just in a pissed off end of the year mood and part of me wants a little more balanced life.
i think both are probably true
it is probably not the best work environment for you but the end of the year makes it feel worse
Yeah
did you know that "personal appearance" is now a protected category in some places?
What does that mean
i don't know i'm assuming tattoos and piercings
Hmmmm interesting
I want to run away from our world
Me too
I need some help with some stuff can you come home
yeah i'm pretty much done here anyways. i'll pack up now
Thanks
is it time for our vacation yet?
I know right!
A teacher pissed on me first thing this morning!!!
she's a jerk
Yes
ppl like to take their bad mood out on the priest because it is the equivalent of kicking the dog
Yeah...is fine just annoying
i'm sorry ppl are being so rotten but it is almost over
True...can't wait!!!
our house is worth 278 now
That's good.
Not sure it matters though
I went for a drink with some teachers bad idea it really depresses me
I'm not hungry but I'll make dinner for you if you want
We were listening to music and Josh goes Jazz hands!
That's my boy
I'm getting crap from the of tutoring center here about my og work outside of here.
I was like I gave you the option of paying for it. You said no...so sad too bad your loss
the school is giving you crap about doing tutoring on your own?
turns out my tutor is tutoring another guy named andrew and he got confused
Oh awesome!
i have 30 hours left
so my tutor just texted me and set up a meeting for tonight
Great!
What time
6:30 to 7:30
i'll be home around 8
Cool
i was going to try and run this stuff to the UPS store but i'm not sure i'm going to have the time to get there and back now
i might try again tomorrow
i have my performance review tomorrow
the girl that told me she applied for the promotion just told me she didn't get it
Well I guess that's good for you .. what do you think?
no, i agree it is good for me
i know it is stupid but i am a little anxious about the fact that my performance review is late on a friday afternoon
Oh really...hmmm...
Well who knows but we will be fine either way
Josh is showing Jude his work and Jude's all what is he saying
Josh he's talking chinese
Jude what is he saying
Josh I do t know I don't speak Chinese
i read my review
And...
he basically agreed with everything i said in my review and said when i'm right i'm really good but there are obvious technical holes that are consistent with my level of experience
not an awful review for being on my second year of an audit
Well that's good
yeah unfortunately all of my skills are in the part of the job that i don't do right now
Oh bummer
i think it is normal for someone to take 2-3 years to learn the skill of auditing.  my first two years were really one year because it was a new audit.
once i get my CPA and get another year or so under my belt i'll be crushing it i think
That's awesome
How did it go
I'm struggling...
Just cus you're tired?
We have a long weekend which I think will help
And your almost to the end of the year
This bishop visit is pushing me over the edge I just want to cry
Just remember the only real power he has is to hire and fire and on his way out he won't me firing the priest in charge of a country parish
It's just stressful last minute sucks
True
You could make it your mission over the summer to get all the bulletin for the year drafted
I'm can't do this
I'm failing at everything
You aren't failing at anything
Everyone is elated with you
I think you are amazing I know you are carrying a lot but you only have a week to go and then you get the whole summer off
I've been stepping in it a lot lately because my anxiety and exhaustion are crazy
I'm not a teacher but I think everyone just blows all of this end of the year stuff off
And my mom is starting to face how bad she is...
She's starting with a new dr
That's good right
Yeah and sad...
She asks me stuff a million times
I'll give you her number....thank you very much!!! Her name is Lindsey....843.754.4094
Once y'all know what you are doing...can you just shoot me a text so I know...I'm a control nut...😂🤦🏼‍♀️
Thank you so so much...he knows this but he's allergic to dairy, beef and pork
This is the message about caleb
Just got Caleb around 330
Don't keep him too long because I'm going to have him for the day tomorrow too...
Ask the boys if they want to go to the zoo?
Are you ok?
Taking him home now
Ok
Boys said the zoo could be fun
When does your show get out
I'm in the five and 8
So midnight?
That sucks I'll try to get the kids in the morning why don't you sleep in Jude's bed and close the door
Ok. No big deal though. I think I might take them to James island Park for the morning since I'll have Caleb and then come home for a nap and a movie then dinner with my parents out somewhere
How was your day I miss you guys
Zinus Memory Foam 12 Inch Green Tea Mattress, Full https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Q7EPPDA/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_LHY6Cb9KDC2XG
Mattress for Jude I got a gift card for 250 from Amazon
I miss you too
I like the mattress
Ok
I love you
❤
Do we have flashcards anywhere around the house
Nm I found some
We usually eat at 530
Let me know when you are done at the pool and I'll head over
Okay
We are at the house
Did we ever figure out how much we owe on the minivan
no i'm having trouble getting a hold of them
i need some time to get in touch with then during business hours when i can talk on the phone and be in front of a computer
I just made an appt with a dr
that's good when is the appt
Tomorrow
that's good
is it with dr p?
No a hormone clinic in mt pleasant
oh good
i'm starting to lose faith in dr p
Yeah me too
Vans paid off
No way how much?
4200
That's not bad I'm putting in 2400 today
yeah go ahead and put it in the savings account
Okay
and then we can focus on the sonata
i'll put an extra 1000 on the payment every month and it will get paid off fast
Sounds good
and that will be an extra 600 in our pocket each month by the end of the year which is awesome
Is Josh's shoe in the van?
I don't think so...
I'm sorry
This is a bad mood house today perhaps earlier to bed tonight
Yeah sorry I let them stay up a little late and watch a movie
I'm just ready for school to be over and I think they are two
how did your day go
Ok. You?
its fine
slow
i'm trying to get some studying done during the slower times
That's good.
Im St the Dr waiting to get labs done. I'm exhausted
I was outside all day.
And, I just need a break you know?
totally get it
i think it is good timing for a vacation
Yeah
i think that is part of this whole retirement focus
i'm looking at our life and thinking i don't want to do this forever
I hear that.
I literally did nothing I'm sorry house is a mess but I just couldn't
i don't think you should
i wanted you to go home and do nothing
you don't do enough nothing in your week
nothing is an important part of keeping sane
so i was just looking online
And...
our bank's savings account is 0.03% but citibank has a savings account that is 2.36%
as a comparison inflation currently is 1.9%
So you want to switch?
i'm thinking about it
currently we are losing money on our biggest lump sum of cash
it will honestly come down to what citi's mobile banking is like probably
Ok
on 20k we would go from losing 400 a year to making 100
That's great
I just got home and I think the AC is broken
awesome
i was thinking that we should turn the AC to 77 or something after talking to your dad last weekend
it of course happened right after we paid off the car
you want me to call an AC guy?
I have had the AC on 78
Today it's 90 in here
that's a bummer
yeah we need to call someone i guess and see if they can get there before we leave
I'm gonna have my dad check first
ok
Ok. Yes please call.ac guy
Dad says to remind them they were supposed to have fixed it last year
do you remember who we used
My dad uses Berkeley
was he the one that scheduled it
No
I'm just pretty sure we asked him last time
ok done
i called, he is going to come "sometime between noon and 5... maybe after"
Tomorrow?
i'm going to telework tomorrow at least until you get home
yes
Okay
in the meantime i'd turn off the AC
or maybe turn it on fan
My dad says it's the fan motor do you want to call them back and tell them to bring a motor for the heil brand ac
My dad says it's the fan motor do you want to call them back and tell them to bring a motor for the heil brand ac
500 dollar fix
yeah
i'm also signing us up for a maintenance plan
170/yr
Ok.so you are going to call back?
yes
Ok. I'm having a major anxiety attack I'm sorry if I'm not following
no worries
this is why we have savings we'll be fine
i updated the file
Im not fine...it's not fine.
no, anything under 1000 is not a big deal
we have the funds for these sorts of emergencies
we have a plan
if you think it is going to be hard to sleep i'm sure you guys could go to your parents for the night
I don't know
i love you
i will make this right
Ok love you too
it's it great that they were able to get us in 24 hrs
and that your dad was able to diagnose the problem so they can be sure to bring the right part
I agree
and 500 is really not much money
Yeah
and thank goodness we put those fans in the boy's rooms so everyone will have a fan tonight
this could be a lot worse
we are pretty well prepared for this
i'm glad it isn't going to effect our vacation plans
Yeah
Julie says I can work from home the second half of the day
So I got it
We don't have students and there's basically nothing for me to do
ok so two things
Yes
1) we want to have them maintenance the unit while they are here and get us on the maintenance plan.  I told the woman on the phone that we wanted to be on the plan but she sorta blew me off about it
so make sure they know that
Okay
2) tell them just to bill us don't worry about paying for it tomorrow
Okay
Is it okay if the boys and I eat out so that I don't have to cook in our super hot house
totally
😊
see it's like a vacation from life
Ok...I'm.worried about the Dr she said my results were complicated and better to talk thru with Dr. St first she said she'd walk.me thru them
ok
when will that conversation happen
Tuesday
well this is how i'd look at that.  this means that they found something so you aren't crazy and they aren't going to blow you off again which is great.  now we can do something about it.  and i don't think it is bad news otherwise they'd want to talk sooner.  so I'd take that at face value and say it is complicated which you kinda already knew because sometimes its there and sometimes not
So I'm cooking cause it just got too crazy to stay out
would you like me to leave now and bring you guys home something
No it's ok.
you could just chill out and have delicious food brought to you
I would stay out if I were you.
sorry it is miserable
it's only for one night
It's fine
I'm sort of peicing something together so you may want to get something for you
ok
i think there is steak
and burgers
you guys should eat out back on the porch
Maybe.
We are blessed with a much cooler day today!
agreed
it is overcast
like god hid the sun just for us
Thank God!
I'm sorry I'm such a mess...
Hey I'm just stopping at Walmart so call me if that ac guy comes
ok
Haven't heard from him yet
Okay
So Jude and Josh need to be picked up by 830 at St Andrews family fitness center.
I've been so productive today I feel.so much better
k no problem
good
Air is fixed!
nice
Everything with maintenance plan etc was 349
see... blessed
what was wrong with it?
Boys are on their way to soccer fun I made shrimp for dinner
Capacitor was broken
did you talk about a maintenance plan?
Yes I signed up for maintenance plan that's included in the price
he didn't do it for free because you're so cute?
Lol
i totally would have done it for free if i saw you
😊
I love you!
It's finally raining
Yay!
They said they had fun but they didn't learn about anything
Ok. Well I'm.glad they had fun. I miss you guys!
Is it cooler in the house...I'm.exhausted
yes it feels normal here
Awesome! Can I sleep in tomorrow?
yes although i wish you would have asked me that an hour ago becausei have no way of making that happen
let me see if jude is still awake
No it's ok.
I'll just sleep dow.stairs
i just moved him
you sleep in his room
😊
lock the door josh is a sneaky one
Yeah he's a snuggler
I may have to settle for a nap later in the day
How r u guys doing?
Waiting to get into our movie
Fun
We miss you
Miss you, too
Aladdin?
Yeah
Josh is doing that thing where he doesn't want to do anything
Oh bummer
I'm almost done with this preclass work two lessons left?
That's awesome! I'm so proud of you
Thanks!
hey if you have time to take your motorcycle today that would be great. I'm going to try and get the van ready for the trip
I got a cooler that I put in there. I thought we could put lunches in it
Lunches?
I didn't really plan on bringing food but I can
I don't care we don't need to we just usually do
just found out that the little girl in my office that hasn't even started her CPA got promoted
Oh really bummer
totally sucks
so apparently if i had spent the last 2 yrs just learning the craft rather than studying cpa stuff it would have resulted in faster promotion
Yeah but long term would limit how far you can go
perhaps but the only one on my team that has their CPA is the guy that just got promoted
my manager and 
Sr. Manager don't have it
CPA or not made no difference in promotion for the ppl that got it apparently
Well...what do you think about that
i find it discouraging
i want to go talk to Bryan about it
Well I think that's a good idea but perhaps take some time first to think about what you really want to say
i understand that if she spent the time learning auditing she may be technically proficient but the implicit message that promoting her at the same time as those with CPAs is that the CPA isn't a consideration
Or just that being a woman in a math field makes them look good
that's lame
so i have a penis so i need a CPA to keep up with her
I know but...
i don't think that is it
that better not be it 
Maybe not
do you have tutoring tonight? If not is there any way you could get home at 5:30 I forgot I'm supposed to be at this stuff thing at 6
yeah i can come home
Okay, thanks
Can you call me
ok
How r u doing today?
i'm ok
It's almost time for vacation!!!
i know i'm pretty ready to be done for a while
It's gonna be great!!!!
are you home for the day already?
I'm.done but I have that Dr appointment
oh right
Do you love me
i do love you
i look forward to a day that we will get to spend time together again
I can't wait
new plan, the kids aren't being crazy because they have too much energy it is because they are too tired. We're headed to a movie.
Okay
I'll drop the boys off when the movie is over
Ok...drop them.off ?
Prolly won't be until 4:15-30
So I'll take them straight to your parents
Ok bring them to the house im cleaning getting things ready for next week
No bring them here
I cleaned our shower this morning
Thank you
This was a bad idea...there's apparently a ton of work at night and I didn't do all the prerequisites I thought I'd had...
I stayed
thought that was probably the case
would they not refund you?
No they said I'd be fine
Did the boys get to camp o
Ok?
yeah
there looked like there were some good prospects for friends
Ok...you ok?
they got off without any major issues
Awesome!
yeah
Ok.the Dr called we need more tests I told her next week
yeah that's a good choice
Ok.. apparently the first woman I talked to was just crazy
good
i'm sure some ppl are just not happy to be there on the first week of their summer break
Yeah
Plus like half the people in here made the same mistake as me so the teacher was pissed
well it seems like that is a pretty good indication that the syllabus was not written well
Yes yes it does
there is a dinner with the big wigs on thursday
i'm assuming you will be studying and can't go
Probably not unless you want to get a babysitter
Chicken and rice or hamburgers for dinner?
hamburgers will work
Okay
No need to rush home the homework would be hard but I've already taken this part really
do you think you'll need me home earlier the rest of the week?
I don't think so
i love you
Love you too you ok?
yeah i'm fine i'm just stressed
Why?
this tutor sick thing is not awesome
I'm sorry
it's fine i'll figure it out
I got someone to take my Savannah tomorrow.
This class is in kicking my ass I can't be out late
ok
do you need me to come home anyways so you can just study
No
We have to write all out own reading passages
this class does sound pretty crazy
It really is
I need to print some stuff tonight can I use your computer
yes but you will have to plug in the printer
and you might need to hunt down some paper after your lasst thing
Okay
I have a headache that won't quit today
it's the weather

Birthday cake
For you? So sweet
well technically it was for me and the other guy that has the same birthday but i'm the one that wears bow ties
That's awesome
Saralyn can't do tonight can I do it or do you need to be out
I can come home
Let me finish things up here I can be out in about 20
Don't rush no need to get home till 7
Today's a gymnastics day right?
When does it start
The mom guilt of doing this show is eating me alive
Everything ok?
I was returning your call
Oh ok...boys ok? My mom.guilt is crazy
I have to do another crazy test at the Dr.
that's a lot of tests
Can you call me when you get a sec
You awake
Still studying
Ahhh....
so not that i'm bitter or anything but i can't believe that my Sr. is a Sr. and i'm an associate.  I answer his questions all the time
That sucks
What are you doing tonight? This weekend?
i don't have a plan
It's father's day weekend what would you like to do
studying feels futile until i get a tutor but i've lost two weeks already on my timeline
i'd like to spend the weekend with you guys
Okay well figure out what you might want to do and we'll make it happen
So are you going to work late tonight
i'm not going to stay super late but i will try to get a little bit of work in
Okay
sorry
do you need me home so you can get work done?
No I'm done for now
I would like to know what the plan is for this weekend like are you going to study at all
how about i study 3 hours saturday morning and then i can study Sunday from 3-7 in the evening
and the rest of saturday i'd like to spend with you guys
could we flip that the boys and I got an invitation to a pool party in the afternoon
We could go to IHOP in the morning and then go play disc golf
sure we can go to IHOP and do something
i think i'm going to go on sunday to dis golf with the boys
i know how you hate it so
Sounds good
What size pants are 5
You?
you guys really don't need to get me anything
i'm good
i just want to spend time with you guys
What size pants shirt are you
Size?
I went with 36 34l
Don't forget it pick up groceries
I actually just finished telling the boys to put clothes after their baths so we could go
Ok
Hey don't worry about the book shelf. It's going to rain a bunch next week I'm.sure the boys and I will have time to do it.
My mom.cancelled dinner tonight. Thought you might want to blow off everything and go to Myrtle Beach
i just looked at my NTS and it expires on July 17
so i think i'm going to move my anticipated date to July 15
Okay
So I don't understand does that mean you have to reapply to sit again
no it means i'm going to move my test date up and hope for the best
i should be most of the way through anyways and if i don't feel confident I can keep studying for FAR so I don't lose any time
Okay I love you
i love you too
i am sorry about this CPA thing, i know it has been hard on you
I just need the summer to recuperate I'll be fine
I was trying to cook two things at the same time today and I burned a whole batch of meatballs beyond repair
i love crunchy meatballs
No like I forgot they were in there for a whole hour it was awful
oops
I'm sorry
Any chance you could stop and pick up my medicine at Walgreens tonight
what time does walgreens close again
like 8?
10
I could go right now but the traffic is crazy so you can go or you can come home and I'll go when you get home
no i can do that
Thanks
I'm really annoyed that my mom ust keeps springing all this hard crap in me like it's nothing
My uncle is dying
I'm sorry to hear that. Which uncle, Larry?
Noel I guess it's fine just weird
Yeah, I get it. Even if you don't have a great relationship, and possibly even more in those cases, it is hard when family dies
I made burritos

I want this for the corner of the OG room just saying
I love you.
i love you too
You'll be home by 630?
yes
i'm going to leave right at 5
Thanks
How did the tutoring go?
it was good
she is hard to understand and not quite as good as greg but better than any of the others so far
Ok...
Boys in bed?
I'm exhausted. I really need to be done here
yeah
i hear that
These late nights kill me
it sucks getting old
Yes yes it does I'm fat and tired good thing your stuck with me
I don't think you're fat and I wouldn't want to be with anyone else
"the problem is not how we finance medicare it is how we deliver it." Mark Bertolini
quote of the day
Lol
I'm doing this stupid test today it's stressing me out
why for?
it's just information gathering
my older tutor had a blood clot and apparently was on a feeding tube for all this time
Oh gosh is he going to be ok?
The test 8s just hard to organize not scary just annoying
they said they were able to get the clot out and he is stable now which is good
That's great!
are you guys doing anything fun today?
No. Worked out OG nap gymnastics
its a good nap day with the rain and all
Yeah we were all exhausted
I have at least 10 more hours of reading to do for this class plus homework in two more days of training
do you need time to get it done
do you want me to come home?
No...it's just a lot I hate reading off the computer.
I'm.a good mom right?
you're a great mom
and we have great kids 
Ok thanks
our life is pretty blessed.  It is sometimes hard to see that or feel that with the day to day of studying and crazy schools and bosses and whatever but we are really good.
It's true
We should hang the rings up in the backyard for the kids to practice
i like it
😊
have they learned rings yet?
They are working on them right now
oh cool
Yeah
Hey I was just thinking about it and wanted to know if you have a plan for paying our pledge
yes
Okay
i'm going to pay 200/ wk
what did you pledge 5k?
4k
ok
I'm having the worst panic attack...sorry if I'm not myself
Be careful the weather looks scary
I was going to come home but now I'm thinking I might wait this out here
I would it's hailing
Just looked at the dopler and it looks like I might be waiting until 9
Ugh
You guys couldn't have asked for a better day
Yeah it was good
Hamburgers good for dinner will you be home by 630for me?
Sounds great Im headed out at 5
Okay
I just found out I'm in both shows tomorrow...
530 and 830
Wow that's a lot I'm sorry
So I guess you won't have the whole day
Att is coming on Monday between 8-10
Okay
i did deposit that check on 5/29
Okay, thanks
good morning
Morning 🌞
Atand t is here
How did your presentation gp
it went well
did they fix anything with the internet?
Yes it's all set they even fixed the second line so now we have two
good
at least until the next rain storm
He gave me his direct cell phone in case there's another problem.
Can you meet me at black Fedora at 7pm to get boys tonight
I have a show
Sure
Thanks
I made homemade not burned meatballs
sounds delicious thank you
How much do we pay for Google fi
it depends on how much data we use
lately we have been hovering in the $80s
if we use almost no data we could get it down to the 60s i think
Okay
i think if we both used all the data we wanted it could get as expensive as 150 but don't hold me to that
Okay
Josh just got into creecs
I think they are going yo try to find a spot for Jude too
....
are you happy or anxious about that?
I'm psyched I have no idea how it would work but I'm psyched!
good
i'm glad
Hey the boys want to stay and see my show which is fine it's summer so no need to come pick them up
Ok
i finally got my exam scheduled
Awesome
i love you
I love you too I'm.sorry I'm always upsetting our lives
you are upsetting anything this is life
i know these are hard decisions but there is no one else i'd rather make them with than you
Thank you
I love you
The job at Creecs has been filled
ok
that was fast
I think it's one of those who you know things
the office is leaving netflix
Oh bummer
And our toaster oven is dead
hows that?  i just used it this morning
I plugged it in every plug and can't get it to hear up...tried every setting but you should try when you get home
yeah i'll look at it
I'm having a sad day
why
I think I'm just lonely I tried setting up playdates but no one is around
are your parents taking the boys today?
No tomorrow
oh bummer
you want me to try and get home a little early?
or maybe we could do a dinner date tomorrow?
It's ok your test is coming up. Tomorrow I have an evening meeting in McClellanville
yeah but we both need to eat we could do that together on your way out of town perhaps
there is  east bay deli just down the street from my office
Maybe my meeting is at 6
yeah so i could meet you at 5? we could eat from 5-5:30?
It takes an hour to get to McClellanville
I could meet you for lunch
maybe i could even get out a little early like 3 or 4?
we never really made a firm decision about lunch did we
Yeah I figured you didn't want to you or couldn't make it work so I'm on my way to McClellanville
It was nice to talk with you this morning though
I screwed up
How sis
how did you scre up?
I messed up the dates I finish this class
Total mess now it's the same week as VBS and I had to change the boys camp
that sounds like a totally fixable problem
Yeah I'm just out of sorts
In good news I have a check here
i was wondering when we would see one of those
End of each month
Why not looking good?
no we are fine
so i made a slight mess up
not a big deal but i paid a little bit more on the car than i intended to
What's that
What's that
What does that mean
nothing really
just means we are closer to having it paid off
Okay
this girl in my office that is definitely under 30 used the phrase "as i've gotten older..."  
i laughed
Lol
i remember when i was 27 and i thought i was an adult....
Another att sighting ...fibre optics here we come!
And I gave Jude an assessment test today and he rocked it!



Plus three geocache successes
 i think a lot of his problem is he gets anxious about tests
looks like a really good day for everyone, which i was there!
So I just got a job offer I'm really excited about
Kinda...
that's exciting you want me to call you?
Ummm....hmmmm I think I need to process more
so yes?
Yes!
didn't you say you have a show tonight?
Tomorrow
Looks like the job is going to fall through again
Andrea thought they worshipped at 9 but it's 10...she's not sure they'll go to 9
i'm sorry, i know you were excited about it
Yeah...
i'm not sure they have a choice with 15 ppl but that is the bishop's call i guess
i can't imagine there are a lot of ppl that are willing to drop everything to come to a dysfunctional diocese to be a place holder for 15 ppl
I agree
Sometimes I just don't know if I can
Do it anymore
Did you make anything for dinner
8f not I might stop and get something on my way home
O was going to eat steak
Cool you ok?;
I'm not feeling like myself
On my way
Playing apples to apples card is complicated Josh puts down women
lol
see, he knows that intuitively
Yeah
i actually can't find a comfortable position to be.  my back is acting up...  bummer
I'm sorry
it's just a sign i need to retire early
If it helps I've been thinking I need to check into the hospital all day

i love you
You too.
East Cooper says they'd switch to 9 for me
that's awesome right!
I don't know
it seems like it is another wait and see thing
Yeah I'm only going to seriously consider it if Creeks works out
do you think that the colonial american flag is inherently racist?
Ummm kinda
interesting
The kids are both in at creecs
that's great
Maybe....not sure how it will work maybe this is stupid
I don't think it is stupid. I think that the kids getting into a great school is a high priority
You should add some avocado to the last of the chicken salad and make a sandwich
The internet is down for all of Charleston
Bleck ours is fine
I think it might be mostly Comcast
I think we need to say no to creecs
I can't see trying to commute that
It's possible I may need to come to come home to do this tutoring session
If so I'll lock myself in the other room so I don't throw off your flow
Ok
Ok
We were approved up to 400000
But he couldn't check my credit still so we need to call about that
Check out 1123 daffodil ln.
Are you around?
yeah you need to talk
No just wanted to let you know we drove by the townhouse and its really nice
It's also right near a Walmart and a bunch of restaurants Starbucks
that's exciting
well if it is near a coffee place then it is a sign we need to buy it
It's got plenty of parking
And it would take you about 25 minutes to get to work
that's not bad
seems like everything is starting to fall into place
Maybe
Hoa fees are 360 a month
Heck no
Found some single family homes that are really nice under 300000
I literally living my worst nightmare the power is out in McClellanville
Just me and two kids low battery
Lol
Go play in the rain
We went for a bike ride did I mention no water
What do you mean no water?!?
i think it's gonna rain
I don't think so
Lol
Yeah I'm not going to get much done today...sorry
if you get some time to relax without kids i think it will be a productive day
I went grocery shopping and got the stuff at Lowe's and had to.do some liturgy planning so I need a hot sec
Before black fedora
the resting is the most important part
Ok
all of the sudden i'm regretting riding my bike today....
Yeah I'm nervous about driving to fedora
if you can make it down it should be fine on the way back
So I've been thinking and praying
and?
Perhaps we live in the Morrison house come August and begin to sell the house then...less cleaning we can in clutter by moving some stuff to the Morrison house
It won't be a whole year until we can find something I'm sure
And it gives us a small trial time at creeks without ruining our marriage
yeah, no that probably makes the most sense
I love you.
i love you
we will figure this out
i do agree the best way to make it through is together
I agree
I hate being here...
The first show was fun but now I'm just exhausted and want to go home
i'm sorry
sounds like it is about time for you to be done with BF
Yeah
All this stuff going on I would usually talk to my mom.about but she can't be that for me...it makes me super sad
I think we are going to stick around here today so we have more time before the party
Okay
Jude just told me all about this book he was reading so I assumed it was something you guys read together. Then he said "yesterday mom didn't make me do any reading so I'm doing it today"
He said he chose to read two chapters on his own!
You should feel awesome about the progress you are making with him
That's awesome
I'm stopping at jersey mike you want anything
No that's okay I'm not hungry
How did the party go
Did Josh warm up to Caleb once he got there
No
Oh sorry
I just talked to creecs I don't think it's worth the move
I think that's a good choice
We will look at a move in a couple years
Hamburgers in the fridge
fortuitously, i just got a text from the mortgage company that said they think we could refinance for a lower rate if we wanted
That's good
it is really how long we think we will be here.  it might be good to refinance and keep paying the same amount so we are paying less in interest though
Yeah
there was a bomb threat at a mosque in germany
i wonder who bombs a mosque
Apparently there is a bus to creecs from.mt pleasant
Does that change our mind
where and when does the bus pick up?
Several areas throughout my pleasant
Coastal bus line it's 400 a quarter though...nope don't think it changes my mind
is that 400 per kid
like over 3k a year?
Yeah
yeah that's a lot of money i'm not sure if that is feasible
Yeah
they better get breakfast and a tutor on that bus
Ok...
Lol
that's a lot
i think we made a good choice
i don't think you need to worry
I always worry...I don't want to mess Jude up
i don't think you are messing him up
he has a lot of advantages that most don't get he'll be fine
I have VBS and two hours of homework...
Being a mom is so hard sometimes. I do so much for our kids I feel.super drained
when does VBS start
i hear that
you happen to be really good at being a mom even when you are drained
I'm already a little behind starts at 430 goes till 8
quote of the day.  The Fed Chair just said, "at the end of the day the country is it's educational system."
perhaps a little motivation for your class
So my teacher says I'm doing an excellent job with Jude
She's going to come and watch him and help me
that's not news
you are an amazing teacher and could really be amazing as a tutor
I am feeling really overwhelmed today
I'm sorry. Just focus on one thing at a time you are doing a great job
So I got everything done except dinner and there's a ton of food in the refrigerator so just pop something in the oven
you are amazing
thank you for how hard you are working
i know that it is a lot but you are pretty amazing at this tutoring thing
Thank you
At the beginning they want to see all of my complete lesson plans so it's just a lot right now
yeah i know but it will be worth it
not really because of the money or because of jude but because i do think you could change these kids lives
oakland changed my life in lots of ways and i think you could do some of that same work
Hopefully
you said that you and the boys are going to be home until like 8:30 or something right?
Yes
cool i'm going to study at home
Okay
did you know they have pet cpr masks
No
That's ridiculous
i know right if your dog is having a heart attack just go in there mouth to mouth
All you!
i don't know where the love has gone
she'd do it for you
Went to joint, didn't work
Oh bummer I'm sorry
it probably my fault i got all freaked out when they told me they were going to adjust my spine without x-rays so i think the guy went really gentle on me and didn't do much
it was feeling better basically until i got out of the car back at the house
Oh no
How's it going?
It's going
That good
I went through taxes and inventory and feel ok with those
I actually feel pretty good about inventory and good enough about taxes
I'm hitting not for profit now
Awesome!!!
Then lunch
Is it good having the house to yourself
I tried to do Jude's bed and we got the wrong size
It is nice to be here and study in truth I prolly could have gone to the office if need be
It's too hot you'd die
Can we return the bed
We are stuck in Myrtle beach in the worst storm
yes but you went to get wet right?
They closed everything
And I don't know if we should go to McClellanville because of the storm
hmmmm
these things tend to pass pretty quickly i'd wait and see
you can feel free to come back though if you'd like
i think i'm going to be done for the day in about an hour or so
i want to get myself on an earlier schedule for this test
Okay
I love you. We are going to stay at Morrison house
ok i love you too
i'm gonna give you a call in a few
Okay, sounds good
I love you I know your working hard just do the best you can and remember we are praying for you
My brain hates me
I'm sorry
I'll be there by 5
I'm only a mile away if we ever move
Did you get pictures of all the cool bike tricks
Sorry no pictures but I'll send you some from the mental hospital
lol
We are going yo the moviesbe home by 530 when I'll be leaving to workout so you and the boys can have some man time
My mom's not keeping kids overnight and I'm two hours into this test and only half way through....
😭
yeah that stinks
i'm sorry bean
i know you were looking forward to the night off from the kids
Oh well
if she keeps them until i get out of work then i can take them from her so you don't have to see them and you can still have a day without kids in it
No no behind the I'm just sad about our date
Literally just finished the test OMG
yeah that's a long test
i'm bummed too
maybe this sunday?
And I drove all the way to Mount pleasant and they lost my massage appointment
Want to pick up hibachi for dinner
sure
wait how did they 'lose' your appointment
Just my luck I guess
i'd tell them that's not acceptable
you made an appointment  you showed up on time they need to make it right
Yeah they didn't
Okay now the boys are staying at my parents tonight
oh my gosh i can't keep it all straight
I know
i think your mom is trying to wear us out
so you want to go out
should i meet you somewhere or come home and we can drive together?
I just sat in traffic for an hour can we go someplace close?
yes
let me think for a sec
we always say we want to try places and then forget about them when we actually get a date night
Yeah...I'd be ok just getting hibachi and hanging here
i can handle that
Cool
i've got like 5 more minutes here you should go get a epison salt bath and relax
you want me to pick up a movie or something?
I still have lesson plans to do...
No just a chicken hibachi plate
We can rent a movie here
k
I don't have your brother's cell phone number could you give it to me
I have a bunch of small errands to run tonight is it okay if I go out for a couple hours after you get home
2022580067

I got him over Facebook.

Sweet
OMG this place is sooo crowded

Ugh

Are they open today?
no
Bummer
yeah, how was vbs?
Great. My mom is not doing great though
oh no, why
Just a lot of forgetting
oh yeah i'm sorry
i know it is hard to watch that
Yeah
i think i'm going to come right home after work
my back hurts and i don't think i'll be super productive here staying late to study
Okay
I've literally had the same conversation with my mom 3 times today
I'm sorry
I totally forgot I have to take Jude to the orthodontist
Oh no, when is that appt?
1220 I got it....
Did they take you?
Apparently Rick isnt in today until 930
He hasn't shown up yet but they said they would make it work
Good
my best friend at work told me that he just separated from his wife....
Bummer I'm.sorry
yeah i'm pretty bummed about it
he admits it is totally his fault, he's broken from war he just got back and then got married
Hmmm...that's not awesome. Did you recommend counseling
i did
and he didn't seem adverse
I figured out how to change the battery in my remote key
Because he youcanlearnanything on YouTube
ok
that's great
what sort of battery does it take?
i asked the mechanic when i went to get the oil changed and he had no clue
I got you one too it's 2032
k
thanks
The boys just tried on their gymnastics uniforms and they look so cute
Take pictures
I can't they would barely come out of the bathroom
What time are you coming home tonight
Let me know how it goes with the chiropractor
6pm Monday 29th Anson's
12 Anson St Charleston, SC 29401
hey BTW the boys and I have our church photo this saturday at 4.  if you want we can get some pictures for ourselves, i'm sure they will try to sell them to us.
Ok...
looks like we are going to be approved for both days
That's good
What's your plan this weekend?
I don't have a plan for this weekend other than these pictures
Do you have thoughts?
I just didn't know if you had to study
Your dad got Josh a video game system
I'm didn't say anything
R u kidding me
Yeah that's what I thpught
Do you know what you like to do in Myrtle Beach tomorrow
I was going to search for a Groupon
The kids seem interested in family kingdom but I could do anything
Yeah and it seems like a lot of money to spend over going to six flags next weekend
Maybe we should just go to James island county Park water park
Or the beach
It's up to you...
i was sorta thinking about that
what would you like for dinner tonight?
you want me to pick up hibachi 
Nah I have a pork here that needs to be cooked we are good
If you want to do a day trip we could go to Columbia
ok would you like me to cook it?
because you see how if you don't let me figure dinner out then no one is taking care of you?
2-4 next week right?
Yes Friday night and Saturday come home sunday
hotel is booked
Perfect
Ok I lied hibachi sounds great from hibachi hut in Ashley River road chicken bowl
ok
Jude just told me reading has become a lot more fun since he has learned how to do it better
And then my heart exploded
that's awesome bean
you should feel proud
😊
So now PG is saying they are not sure if they need me next week.
Basically being there emergency person means they can treat me like crap
WHAT?!?!
Yep
i think i'd push back a little bit and say there is actually a bit of prep that needs to go into this so if you want a good product you need to give me a solid answer
I did they said they can't
This is why I'm like I want to go part-time so I don't have to say yes to these crazy ridiculous thing
can you say you don't feel comfortable doing something without having prepared and back out
then you get your week back
I might try that...but I already spent the money on the baptism
doesn't matter we can figure out the money
it is more important to me that you go into the school year happy and sane
It will be fine I think the bigger problem this is how they want to use me and I'm not great at the lack of plan with kids.
i totally hear that
fail to plan and you plan to fail and all like that
It's the same problem again and again.. I'm always being put in these awkward positions. It's just not my skill set
it seems like it is becoming your skill set
But at a great personal tole
true
Love you
You, too
Do it's official I am leading camp I get 2000 but I'll have to spend at least 300 on supplies
are you happy or or anxious about it working out like that
Both
that's fair it is a bit of a precarious position for you to be in
What time you coming home tonight?
why are there plans?
No I just thought I might go work out
But no big deal I know you have big wigs with you...
i was thinking between 5:30 and 5:45 but i can get home earlier if that's too late
No we are at sky zone won't be home till 630 anyway
k, perfect
Today was hard with the Dr appts I just need a sec...
i didn't know you went to the dr today
The boys orthodontist and chiropractor
oh yeah i knew about those
what did they say about Josh at the chiropractor?
He's okay but he did adjust his hips a little.
I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow at 2.
And I spent 45 minutes today on the phone with dubose about this woman
did you tell him your concerns
Yes...they have done a ton for this woman its kinda crazy
do you feel less bad about them asking her to get a psych eval now?
Kinda but then they basically asked me to donate my money from next week to her....
It was sketchy
hmmmm
i'd feel differently if i thought she was poor or sick but she isn't really either
I guess she is sick...
?
I mean she has/had cancer
i thought you said she was in remission
She wants money for some experimental treatment
To prevent reoccurrence
They booked me for the wrong type of doctor's appointment and so I still don't have my results back
And I ended up just leaving
OMG that's so annoying! It's like you just can't catch a break this week
Yeah, I know
You have the boys at 5:30 right
yes i'm leaving here no later than 4:50
depends on this meeting
You should go out and do something nice for yourself when you're done at the tutoring center since you don't have the boys
I can get them home washed up and fed
Okay, sounds good
I think I need a new front tire where would you like me to go
thinking about you, hope your morning went ok
Can you stop and pick up some nighttime undies on your way home
Sure do you remember his size?
L
I think I have answers
Okay, thanks
How's it going?
You ok
Can you call me when you get a sec
i hate to bring this up but would it be a good idea if we got a watch for your mom too?
Mmmm...
we could put an app on her phone that lets us know where she is as well if you think that would work better
Yeah maybe
What did you decide I might take boys to see Matilda the musical
i don't really want to go out with the office
i'm happy to hang out with the boys or chill at home alone
Okay shows sold out. I've been cleaning etc. Why don't we rent guardians one and chill
k
sounds great
Boys and I just finished lunch and we are going to lay down
Ok my dad's coming at 2 remember
i should have a bunch of delicious food to bring home
Why is that
leftovers from the office
i'm not sure what will be left but right now there are shrimp and grits and mac and cheese and greenbeans
Cool
i love you
❤
I felt so good all day and now...I have the worst headache
Drink water
I did
Feeling good is good
Better than I've felt in a long time !!!
That's great
how did the sermon go?
Good
There was an active shooter near the kids camp today...they are fine but we're on lockdown awhile
ppl are crazy
Yes yes they are
i think it might rain
I think my job is actually a lot less safe at Porter doubt than I thought
They keep talking about how the Episcopal identity is not a boundary condition and could go away
i don't think they will move on that until the law suit is figured out
Wow so much good stuff happening at Drayton this year!!
Did they fire the principal
No...I think maybe he got some fire
Moved to open court phonics! Yay! And, less homework no stupid spelling lists
No more color charts!!!
Bryan just said there is an open position on this new project but it is going to be overtime
Hmmm....
i think it will be good experience
do you not want me to put my name in?
Why not?
yeah that's what i was thinking
i think it will be a good opportunity and between that and my promotion next year (God willing) it my lessen our need for Porter Gaud
Awesome speaking my language
i do hear you saying you don't like it there i just don't have a ton of options right now but i'm trying
I know it's ok
i love you
I love you too
I forgot your cards can you pick them up from me tomorrow or should I go back to school to get then?
yeah could you do it first thing tomorrow?  i could get them after my shot, after i drop off the kids
Yes
did you say you have a expedia account?
No
didn't you tell me you were busy most of tomorrow?
Yes
Can you call me when you get a sec
I'm free now if you are
I thought the boys watches had come but it was your drugs I think
Oh no it's my backpack tags
Josh almost lost his retainer at RR...
Ooops
How's it going?
I miss you guys!
My show got cancelled so I'm making some healthy meals
Miss you guys
Our ETA is 3, when do you need to leave for gymnastics?
415
K
How's it going
i think i'm ready for retirement
any thoughts on how i can make that happen?
I just got kicked out of teaching reading again
Can we move
that is so stupid
didn't julie put you in there?
No Diana was going to split me in but she changed her mind
Which honestly was a good decision for everyone but me.
that sucks
Yeah I'm like irrationally sad about
i don't understand how it would be a good decision for the children to only have whole language teachers
She doesn't want to change anything this year she wants to observe and see what really needs to be changed
so you aren't going to do the testing then?
that seems like something that would be good to do and you don't even have to change anything immediately
Nope
I think that just like everyone else at porter-gaud it's too stressful to try and change anything so it's easier to keep it status quo
And, she's drinking the water that we're not at school for students in need
Which is true. So really it's just not the right place for me which is not news
right and if she was to do the testing she'd have to face the reality that most kids would fail
Right
There is a chaplaincy job open in Columbia and the housing price is much lower there and there's a great school for dyslexic children
no i think when we move we need to get out of the state
Ok
i think you were right we need to find states and counties that have really great public ed and look for placements around there
Ok...I'm just feeling really defeated
i understand that, it sounds like a hard environment
perhaps you can look to get your masters and just hide in your office 
Yeah
that's basically what charles does right?  he just hides in his office and studies
Yes
