# AI_project
an ongoing project to make a protocol droid al la C3P0.

The first version of this project has simple 'Alexa' style command and response. However, the larger vision for the project is a bot that uses machine learning to translate language between two humans such as German and English.  I would also like this bot to scrap the internet to provide information and conduct conversations when prompted.

I had the idea of adaptive conversations so that it would recognize and store user preferences based on face recognition to initiate conversations.  For instance, it might know that dad likes to talk about golf but mom likes to talk about knitting.  When dad prompts for a conversation with "good morning, how are you?" the bot might scrap the net to return, "well, did you see the news about Tiger Woods this morning?" The bot would also be able to predict recurring requests such as providing a weather update every morning or traffic updates before asked when it determines that is of interest at a particular time of day.  

Finally, I would like the bot to play games such as chess, tic-tac-toe, or checkers and perform chores such as paying bills online, providing remminders of appointments and important dates, and investing.
